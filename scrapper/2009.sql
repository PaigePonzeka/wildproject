<p>The Wild Project Gallery and Humble Arts Foundation are pleased to present <i>As We Came Together We Will Go Together</i>, an exhibition of photographs by Hannah Whitaker. The show takes its title from the fable of the Biddenden Maids, a set of conjoined twins from the pre-medical 1100s, setting the tone for the duality threaded throughout the exhibition. In the myth, when one twin died and it was proposed that they be separated so that the other might live, the surviving sister replied, \"As we came together we will go together,\" and died shortly after. In these photographs, Whitaker uses patterns and repetition, both naturally occurring and rendered by hand, to investigate the interdependence of opposing halves. The case of the twins exposes the paradoxical rift between scientific understanding and lived experience explored throughout the show--its emotional implications are complex while the math is simple. Her dark, often uncomfortable images, which include mangled trees, snakes, and sword and fire swallowers, challenge conventional sequential logic to explore her interest in the misleading simplicity of visual clarity, and how these serve as metaphors for human anxiety.</p>

<p>Humble Arts Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that works to advance the careers of emerging fine-art photographers by way of exhibition and publishing opportunities, limited-edition print sales, twiceannual artists grants, and educational programming.</p>
<p>The Wild Project is a new environmentally conscious venue for contemporary theater, film, and visual arts. It is dedicated to supporting the arts by offering space and resources to emerging artists. Our programming intends to cultivate a supportive artistic network, explore innovative and thoughtful approaches to art making and by doing so enrich the local community.</p>

	  Ryan Wallace, <i>Quest (Higgs Boson) 3</i>, 2009, 76x48, Oil, Alkyd, Acrylic, Ink, Graphite, Shellac, Cut Paper, Tape, PVA, Mylar on Panel </p>

<p>The Wild Project is pleased to present <i>Minutes to Midnight</i>, Ryan Wallaces exhibit of paintings, drawings, a print edition and window installation. Wallaces recent work stems from his studies of current trends and advancements in science, technology and consciousness. He gathers information from books, websites, trade and mass media publications and television. This data is used as starting points for visual solutions which act as meditations on these themes. The title, <i>Minutes to Midnight</i>, is borrowed from the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists Doomsday Clock. The Clock conveys how close humanity is to catastrophic destructionthe figurative midnight. With the repetitious use of apocalyptic dates throughout the exhibition, Wallace emphasizes the melodrama and theatricality of such predictions to subvert their macabre nature. He displays a wry acknowledgment of humanitys irrational fear and continuous failure to determine lifes meaning through various devices of control while allowing us to believe in a brighter personal dawn.</p>
<p>Ryan Wallace was born in New York City in 1977. He is a graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design 
and has exhibited in galleries and institutions across North America and Europe. He currently lives and 
works in Brooklyn, New York and is represented by Envoy Enterprises. <i>Blindspot</i>, the print included in the 
exhibition, marks his first print edition with Forth Estate. </p>
<p>The Wild Project, a new environmentally conscious venue for contemporary theater, film, and visual arts, is 
dedicated to supporting the arts by offering space and resources to emerging artists. The first gallery and 
theatre space in New York City to have a green roof with numerous varieties of plant species, Wild Project\'s programming intends to cultivate a supportive artistic network, explore innovative and thoughtful approaches 
to art making and by doing so enrich the local community.</p>

	  Leif Parsons, <em>They could not tell if it was part of the performance
(the first 1/4 where they show he is loosing it.......)</em>, mixed media, 51\" x 40\"</p>
<p>The Wild Project, is pleased to present <em>He looked at her, She looked at it, It looked back</em>, an installation of works on paper by Leif Parsons. Parsons’ follows a simple set of rules when drawing: “If one is interested, concentrated, and unafraid then it is hard to make a bad mark. If I falter in any one of these things then I stop drawing.” It is this whimsy and spontaneity of arrangements that gives the work a sense of associative narrative. One gesture feeds the next until a loosely constructed story has arisen. Parsons’ free-form work and flattened perspectives, represents his fascination with drawing and sculpture. Inspired by Philip Guston and Saul Steinberg, the fragmented figures and forms in Parsons’ work collide with one another accessing moments of clarity and spontaneity.</p>
<p>Parsons spent his childhood in Toronto, Canada and currently lives in Brooklyn. He has exhibited throughout the United States and in Canada. In 2007 he was selected as ADC Young Gun.

	  Leif Parsons, <em>They could not tell if it was part of the performance
(the first 1/4 where they show he is loosing it.......)</em>, mixed media, 51\" x 40\"</p>
<p>The Wild Project, is pleased to present <em>He looked at her, She looked at it, It looked back</em>, an installation of works on paper by Leif Parsons. Parsons’ follows a simple set of rules when drawing: “If one is interested, concentrated, and unafraid then it is hard to make a bad mark. If I falter in any one of these things then I stop drawing.” It is this whimsy and spontaneity of arrangements that gives the work a sense of associative narrative. One gesture feeds the next until a loosely constructed story has arisen. Parsons’ free-form work and flattened perspectives, represents his fascination with drawing and sculpture. Inspired by Philip Guston and Saul Steinberg, the fragmented figures and forms in Parsons’ work collide with one another accessing moments of clarity and spontaneity.</p>
<p>Parsons spent his childhood in Toronto, Canada and currently lives in Brooklyn. He has exhibited throughout the United States and in Canada. In 2007 he was selected as ADC Young Gun. His artwork and illustrations have been included in <em>New York Times</em>, <em>New York Times Magazine</em>, <em>Newsweek</em>, <em>New Yorker</em>, <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, <em>Boston Globe</em>, <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>The Walrus</em>, <em>Graphis</em>, <em>Harpers Magazine</em>, <em>BlackBook</em>, J&amp;L Publishing, Broken Wrist Project and <em>Stop Smiling Magazine</em>. </p>

<p>The Wild Project, is pleased to present <i>The Long Way Home</i> a series of photographs by Anna Moller that explore the lush countryside of Värmland, a historical province in Western Sweden. Moller spent her summers there as a child and has been photographing its surroundings for the past 5 years. Her landscapes, shrouded in a dense fog and dotted with the outline of trees, convey a sense of wonder at approaching a familiar place but seeing it afresh for the first time. Anna says of the area If you walk the land you can feel swells of quiet, seas of forests and rivers made of glass. If you look closely you can see the stories of my family.</p>
<p>Anna Moller is a fine-art photographer based in New York City. Her work has been exhibited in New York, San Francisco, and in Europe. Moller works for Getty Images and has a myriad of editorial clients.</p>

<p>The Wild Project is pleased to present <i>Day Of</i>, an exhibition of abstract paintings by Elizabeth Deasy. Her instinctual approach to painting is always about the present moment of creation, leaving the work charged with emotional resonance. The paintings employ a variety of complex color schemes and techniques that create varied spatial propositions and evoke the tactile quality of light.  The following is a statement by the artist about her process:</p>
<blockquote>For me, painting is a practice of being absolutely present with myself. This involves making whatever choices are the most compelling to me in the series of balancing acts that constitute creating, whether those acts are methodical and discreet, or impulsive and brazen. In mixing a palette from scratch, and in trusting the coupled and collective wisdom of my eye and hand, I conjure into existence fragments of my inner world: the parts that lie just beyond the reach of language.</blockquote>

<p>The Wild Project is pleased to present <i>Wildlife Analysis</i>, the first solo exhibition of photographs by Bryan 
Graf. His atmospheric landscapes explore the spaces between description and invention, representation 
and abstraction. 
</p>
<p>In his photographs, Graf draws on the unexpected details of the natural environment surrounding New 
Jerseys post- industrial landscapes. Black and white images of dandelions, crab grass and butterflies serve 
as a foundation for the work. When printing in the darkroom Graf adds an additional layer of fogged color 
film. The results, much of which are left to chance, give way to arresting and hallucinatory imagery. 
</p>
<p>Accumulation plays an important role in Grafs photographs. Influenced by the landscape paintings of 
Gustave Courbet and Peter Doig, he re-visits one image or one place, allowing the cumulative experience to 
take control of the work. Whether the modification is of a small detail, the use of color or cropping, the 
repetitious nature of the images lead the viewer through his elusive wanderings. </p>
<p>Bryan Graf was born in New Jersey in 1982. He received his BFA from the Art Institute of Boston at Lesley 
University in 2005 and received his MFA from Yale University School of Art in 2008. His work has been 
included in several group exhibitions and in <i>Blind Spot</i> Magazine. 
</p>
<p>This is the second collaboration for curators Hilary Schaffner and Kate Greenberg. For more information please contact Hilary Schaffner at 212. 228.1195 or info@thewildproject.com.

<p>The Wild Project is pleased to present <i>Wildlife Analysis</i>, the first solo exhibition of photographs by Bryan 
Graf. His atmospheric landscapes explore the spaces between description and invention, representation 
and abstraction. 
</p>
<p>In his photographs, Graf draws on the unexpected details of the natural environment surrounding New 
Jerseys post- industrial landscapes. Black and white images of dandelions, crab grass and butterflies serve 
as a foundation for the work. When printing in the darkroom Graf adds an additional layer of fogged color 
film. The results, much of which are left to chance, give way to arresting and hallucinatory imagery. 
</p>
<p>Accumulation plays an important role in Grafs photographs. Influenced by the landscape paintings of 
Gustave Courbet and Peter Doig, he re-visits one image or one place, allowing the cumulative experience to 
take control of the work. Whether the modification is of a small detail, the use of color or cropping, the 
repetitious nature of the images lead the viewer through his elusive wanderings. </p>
<p>Bryan Graf was born in New Jersey in 1982. He received his BFA from the Art Institute of Boston at Lesley 
University in 2005 and received his MFA from Yale University School of Art in 2008. His work has been 
included in several group exhibitions and in <i>Blind Spot</i> Magazine.

<p>This is the second collaboration for curators Hilary Schaffner and Kate Greenberg. For more information please contact Hilary Schaffner at 212. 228.1195 or info@thewildproject.com.

<p>Elizabeth Huey</p>
<p>Gallery Hours:<br/>
Thursday – Saturday <br/>
12-6pm</p>
<p>The <em>Wild Project</em> is pleased to present <em>Nite Lite</em>, a solo exhibition of photographs and a slideshow by the artist Elizabeth Huey.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Huey—an accomplished painter—began taking photographs casually, as a means of creating additional visual source material for her paintings.  This exhibition reflects how, through close examination and the act of archiving, these photographs have taken greater precedence in her work.</p>
<p>Set in landscapes with looming architecture and turbulent skies, Huey’s large-scale paintings expose historical and eccentric characters engulfed in psychological scenarios, both sinister and sublime. Inextricably linked, her photos share this same amalgam. The selection of images in the slideshow—varying from absurd party snapshots to serious science projects—vacillates between dualities: humorous and tragic, flat and dimensional, banal and unique, romantic and mischievous. Sharp contrasts and invasive flash intrusions disrupt the photographic frame creating an additional layer of ambiguity and a pervasive supernatural quality. Adept at appropriation and collage, some of the slides included are taken from various sources. Like Huey’s grand tableaus, these images transcend their original intent and source, becoming at once expressive and elusive.</p>
<p>Born in Virginia, Elizabeth Huey presently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. She earned her BA in Psychology from George Washington University and studied at both the Marchutz School in France and the New York Studio School, before receiving her MFA in Painting from Yale University in 2002. She has received awards such as a Terra Museum of American Art fellowship and residency in Giverny, France (2001), a travel fellowship to Italy from Johns Hopkins University (2006), and an Artist Research Fellowship from the Smithsonian Institution (2008). Huey’s paintings have been exhibited extensively both in the U.S. and abroad and are held in permanent collections at the Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art in Kansas City, Missouri and the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia.</p> ', 'Nite_Lite', '2018-05-06 15:31:54', '2018-05-06 15:31:54', '2018-05-06 15:31:54', '2018-05-06 15:31:54', 1, 'publish','galleryarchive');
