The photos display the result of another crime, an act of traffic violence that happened when driver Yosef Lifsh careened onto the sidewalk and killed a young boy named Gavin Cato on August 19, 1991. Güler was present for the funeral, and captured the grief and pain of the community in the midst of the Crown Heights riots.</p>
