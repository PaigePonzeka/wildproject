<p><em>Hasijina Prica (Hasija\'s Story)</em><br/>
Hasija is a woman who was repeatedly raped while in a concentration camp during the Bosnian War. These photos are a glimpse into her everyday life twenty years later (2013). She collects elephant figurines, dolls, etc.</p>

<p><em>Perucac</em><br/>
This is the name of a lake in Bosnia where a mass killing of civilians took place as part of the Bosnian War and Genocide. The photos show the exhumation of the mass grave years afterward, which was only possible after the water level got very low. Volunteers from all over Europe came to help with the digging. At this place of mass killing, Velija himself had escaped execution during the War.</p>

Velija was born on January 1, 1976 in the Bosnian town of Foca. He grew up in Višegrad, Eastern Bosnia, where he lived until the start of the Bosnian War in 1992. During the war, he escaped a mass killing by jumping into the river and swimming to safety on the other side.<br/>
<br/>Today Velija lives in Sarajevo. He has worked as a graphic designer at Supermarket Marketing Agency in Sarajevo since 2006. Photography is his artistic expression, his favorite medium, and his escape from reality, but it is also a part of his family heritage. His exhibition “Perucac” was created in Višegrad at the same location where he escaped execution.<br/>
<br/>For “Perucac”, Velija received ULUPUBIH’s Best Photo Award in 2012. The exhibition was shown in Budapest in 2011 and published in The Financial Times. Velija’s photography has been published in a variety of reputable magazines in Europe including Theater der Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung. He has worked as an official photographer for the International Theatre Festival MESS in Sarajevo, Radiosarajevo.ba Portal, and Sarajevo War Theater SARTR.</p>

<p>Len Jenkin is a self-taught artist, who’s also a playwright, screenwriter, and novelist. His art is influenced by a career in storytelling, stage design, and directing. His work also links to contemporary American \"outsider\" art. The paintings are mysterious narratives, the stories hidden and obvious at once, shadowy, strange and ambiguous. They often include language as well as images. He is a painter of internal landscapes, of the imagination, and of the everyday American scene.</p>
<p>His plays have been done all over the United States, as well as in England, France, Germany, Denmark, and Japan. His most recent international production was in May 2013 in Beijing (PORT TWILIGHT), and U.S. production in Dallas, Texas (TIME IN KAFKA). His novels have been published by Sun &amp; Moon Press in Los Angeles, and Green Integer Press in Los Angeles. The most recent, N JUDAH, is available at Amazon.com.</p>
<p>His paintings were recently chosen to be exhibited at the Governor\'s Island Art Fair in New York City, Fall 2012.</p>

<p>Marilyn D’Amato is a graphic designer based in New York City specializing in the music, event, and entertainment industries for over a decade. A graduate of NYC’s High School of Art and Design and The School of Visual Arts, Marilyn cut her teeth in the industry as a young singer/songwriter signed to Geffen Records (ALMO) in the mid 1990’s, and later a producer and independent record label manager. All the while, Marilyn lent her creativity and design aesthetic to many projects, and ultimately landed as the lead freelance designer for BMI (Broadcast Music Inc.) Marilyn’s designs have been featured in many high profile projects, events, and publications including Rolling Stone, Billboard, Variety, The Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, The Grammy Awards, The ACMs, among others, and have also appeared in the set design for television programs and feature films including HBO’s “The Sopranos,” 20th Century Fox’s “Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith,” and Paramount’s “School of Rock.” Influenced by the urban landscape around her, as well as an obsession with pop art, Americana, and the perfect font, Marilyn embarked on creating original artwork, which has shown in galleries in NYC and has been privately commissioned.</p>
<p>It was her vast collection of musician’s promo photos that inspired the art for the “Pop Goes The Easle” exhibit, which will be part of the CBGB’s Art, Music and Film Festival 2013. Marilyn is thrilled to debut her music-based mixed media canvases at what will be her first ever solo show as an artist.</p>
