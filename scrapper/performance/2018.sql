			ESSEX<br/>
			In this modern toy theater piece, I intend to draw a parallel between the 1819 sinking of the whaling-ship ESSEX by a sperm whale, and the dangerous backlash of overtaxing the Earth’s resources. Like the crew of the Essex, we are engaged in a chase that leads to our own demise. We have already begun to feel the initial repercussions of our own insatiable appetite. Changing weather patterns, drought, famine and pollution whisper a promise to make us castaways set adrift in the only vessel we have.</p>

			by Kate Dakota Kremer, Directed by Philip Gates<br/>
			January 11 @ 8pm<br/>
<br/>
			Intimatics I-III is a series of three movement-plays about intimacy and citizenship. First developed around the time of the 2016 election, the three parts of INTIMATICS (“Match,” “Speak/Box,” and “Threshold”) investigate the ways in which we navigate boundaries and inhabit flawed rule structures while also pursuing new structures of collaboration and social intimacy. Intimatics raises questions about how borders, walls, prisons, laws, and other governmental structures of containment shape the practice of intimacy between individuals and among communities—and how the practice of intimacy might reshape those structures.</p>

			January 13 @ 8pm<br/>
<br/>
			An evening of new works and works-in-progress from the Contemporary Performance network revealing radical experiments in performance. From young makers breaking into and out of the performance scene, this evening event brings together vital forces that are shaping the next frontier of performativity. Existing between the black box of experimental theatre and the white rooms of the art museum, gray spaces explore the marginal zones of performance.</p>

<p>by Michael Weller</p>
<h2 class=\"firstheader\">showtimes &amp; tickets:</h2>
<p>January 20-February 10</p>
<p>Based on the play LILIOM by Hungarian master Ferenc Molnár (which inspired Rodgers and Hammerstein\'s Carousel), JERICHO by award-winning screenwriter and playwright Michael Weller, revolves around the love affair between a scoundrel carousel barker and a maid at a Catholic Young Women\'s Inn. His confused violent passion and her simple unshakable devotion, form the combustible heart of this dark fairytale for grown-ups. Staying true to Molnár\'s marginal Budapest, Weller sets JERICHO at Coney Island during the Great Depression of the 1930s; a place and time when work was scarce, and life was a matter of desperate survival.</p>

We provide a safe, creative space for under-served girls to express their voices, take on challenges and gain the self-confidence necessary to succeed personally, artistically and academically. viBe empowers girls through intensive, free programs, which engage and inspire them to write, create, publish, direct and perform personal and truthful collaborative theater and music.</p>
<p><em><a href=\"http://urbanwordnyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Urban Word NYC</a>:</em> Championing the voices of New York City youth by providing platforms for critical literacy, youth development and leadership through free and uncensored writing, college prep and performance opportunities.</p>
<p><em><a href=\"http://girlbeheard.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Be Heard</a>:</em> A nonprofit theatre company that brings global issues affecting girls center stage by empowering young women to tell their stories. If a girl can change her own life, she can change the lives of girls everywhere. We envision a world in which every girl is valued and encouraged to be a leader and change maker.</p>
<p><em><a href=\"https://www.earsay.org/earsay-youth-voices/\" target=\"_blank\">EarSay Youth Voices</a>:</em> Transforming Trauma Into Art is an EarSay initiative, created and directed by Judith Sloan, born out of our partnership with the International High School at LaGuardia Community College where many teenagers have emigrated to the U.S. from war-zones and conflict-zones. The premise of this workshop is based on healing through artistic expression using a combination of music, movement, theatre and storytelling. This process helps release the stories and stressors that prevent people who have been traumatized by war, economic or natural disasters from moving forward. This program brings an understanding of confronting obstacles through artistic expression to communities that are poor, displaced, or don’t have access to artistic training, serving approximately 450 students. The project grows out of our commitment to creating artistic works that evolve out of individual experience and community. In this case, the community is immigrant and refugee teenagers attending school in New York City. At a time of war, global tension, and polarization, our program encourages a depth of scholarship and storytelling that shapes the experience of the participants, giving them tools to make connections between cultures, shed light on the complexity and humanity of each individual, and deepen what it means or could mean to be part of a global community.</p>

			3PM: Generation Now!<br/>
<br/>
			Poetic Theater Productions’ 6th annual youth poetic theater showcase features artists from New York, Urban Word NYC, Girl Be Heard, viBe Theater Experience, EarSay Youth Voices, and more.</p>
<p><em><a href=\"https://vibetheater.squarespace.com/\" target=\"_blank\">viBe Theater Experience</a>:</em> Working to empower underserved teenage girls to write and perform original theater, video and music about the real-life issues they face daily. We provide a safe, creative space for under-served girls to express their voices, take on challenges and gain the self-confidence necessary to succeed personally, artistically and academically. viBe empowers girls through intensive, free programs, which engage and inspire them to write, create, publish, direct and perform personal and truthful collaborative theater and music.</p>
<p><em><a href=\"http://urbanwordnyc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Urban Word NYC</a>:</em> Championing the voices of New York City youth by providing platforms for critical literacy, youth development and leadership through free and uncensored writing, college prep and performance opportunities.</p>
<p><em><a href=\"http://girlbeheard.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Girl Be Heard</a>:</em> A nonprofit theatre company that brings global issues affecting girls center stage by empowering young women to tell their stories. If a girl can change her own life, she can change the lives of girls everywhere. We envision a world in which every girl is valued and encouraged to be a leader and change maker.</p>
<p><em><a href=\"https://www.earsay.org/earsay-youth-voices/\" target=\"_blank\">EarSay Youth Voices</a>:</em> Transforming Trauma Into Art is an EarSay initiative, created and directed by Judith Sloan, born out of our partnership with the International High School at LaGuardia Community College where many teenagers have emigrated to the U.S. from war-zones and conflict-zones. The premise of this workshop is based on healing through artistic expression using a combination of music, movement, theatre and storytelling. This process helps release the stories and stressors that prevent people who have been traumatized by war, economic or natural disasters from moving forward. This program brings an understanding of confronting obstacles through artistic expression to communities that are poor, displaced, or don’t have access to artistic training, serving approximately 450 students. The project grows out of our commitment to creating artistic works that evolve out of individual experience and community. In this case, the community is immigrant and refugee teenagers attending school in New York City. At a time of war, global tension, and polarization, our program encourages a depth of scholarship and storytelling that shapes the experience of the participants, giving them tools to make connections between cultures, shed light on the complexity and humanity of each individual, and deepen what it means or could mean to be part of a global community.</p>

<p>It\'s summertime in New York City, 1992. In NYC\'s hazy pre-Giuliani,pre-cellphone, pre-Metrocard days, a black kid and a white kid meet in a chance encounter on an uptown D train, chatting hoops, hip hop, and history.
