			Queer sex, power, and Portishead. In 1995, legendary punk feminist author Kathy Acker met Australian media theorist McKenzie Wark in Sydney, Australia and the two fell into a fast and furious love affair, lasting just a few days before Acker returned home to San Francisco. I’m Very Into You is the email correspondence that followed, two weeks of fevered writing on sex, self, and society between two brilliant queer minds at the dawn of the digital age.<br/>
<br/>
			“Why am I telling you all this? Partly ‘cause the whole queerness/identity thing for me stretches through everything, absolutely everything. Slipping between straight/gay is child’s play compared to slipping between writer/teacher/influence-peddler whatever. I forget who I am. You reminded me of who I prefer to be.”</p>

<p>Free Jujube Brown, a one-man play written and performed by Greg “Psalmayene 24” Morrison and directed by Kamilah Forbes, is a seminal piece in the history of Hip-Hop Theatre. The play tells the story of Jujube Brown, a young, accomplished black writer who is arrested and convicted for the murder of a white police officer. Using hip-hop music and dance to embody the different characters in the community as they tell the tale of Jujube, the play speaks on issues such as police brutality, the prison industrial complex, racism, and Black Lives Matter.</p>
<p>Written in 2000 and performed at the 2002 NYC Hip-Hop Theatre Festival, this production is a homecoming for not only the play, but also for Psalmayene 24. Considering today\'s political climate, now more than ever is this play needed in American Theatre.</p>

<p>The Infernal Machine lives comfortably between the worlds of mid-century farce and Greek tragedy in the sparkling translation by Albert Bermel.</p>
<p>He’s arrogant, cocky, virginal and he doesn’t know it yet, but he’s going to have a thing for mom in Jean Cocteau’s witty and urbane retelling of the Oedipus story, The Infernal Machine. In this magical modernization of the Greek tragedy the enigmatic Sphinx is a bored young girl who slips him an answer to that tricky riddle because well... she\'s bored and he\'s handsome and a welcome diversion.</p>
<p>Among the great figures who pioneered the modern movement in world literature, none showed himself more versatile than France’s Jean Cocteau. Poet, novelist, critic, artist, actor, film-maker, Cocteau was also one of the greatest dramatists Europe has produced. Join us for this staged reading featuring the artists of Phoenix Theatre Ensemble and directed by NYITA nominee Karen Case Cook (Don Juan In Hell).</p>

			SUBVERTED portrays the destruction of Black identity as seen through the eyes of Eden, an 18 year-old girl living in any urban city in the USA. Through the colliding viewpoints of 18 friends, family members, and historical figures (all portrayed by actor, writer, and spoken word poet Dominique Fishback) Eden discovers that the promise of “equal opportunity” still, to this day, does not exist. She questions why the people she loves the most continue to live blindly subverted by an unrelenting history that they did not live through, yet inherit and must accept. Eden’s journey will make a difference in our understanding of what true equality actually looks like.</br></p>

<p>TIGUE performs the World Premiere of a new work for percussion, harmonic resonators, and projection by time-artist Randy Gibson.</p>
<p>This immersive performance in harmonic time, The Four Pillars Appearing from The Resonating Discs invoking The 72:81:88 Confluence in a setting of Quadrilateral Starfield Symmetry ATS4 Base 6:81 explores new methodologies in Randy Gibson’s ongoing work to expand and reconstruct the perception of the passage of time. Performed by TIGUE on nine metallic instruments discretely amplified to highlight the resonance of The Four Pillars from within the rich overtone cloud, the work asks performer and audience alike to consider their own perception of time and change.</p>
<p>The Four Pillars Appearing from The Resonating Discs… was commissioned by Avant Media for the 2017 Tangents series. Due to the fragile perceptual nature of this work, late entry cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<p>The CURRENT SESSIONS is pleased to present the world premiere of The Big Balloon by Iranian-Hispanic artist and choreographer Roya Carreras.</p>
<p>In The Big Balloon, Roya Carreras reimagines a vanished childhood memory, surfacing a delicate world of fantasy and fragmented identity. Carreras’ choreography works within a series of deconstructed interiors, recalling domestic scenes from her childhood home in California. Set against field recordings of daily chores, intimate scenes captured on film register the vernacular of her daily routine. Persian rugs and astroturf line living spaces which—at once—act as stage and sanctuary, where Carreras’ distorted balletic gestures are worked into a detailed physical vocabulary. Forgotten vignettes resolve momentarily, before The Big Balloon is finally undone, opening a space to cross unseen cultural boundaries.</p>
<p>A limited-run booklet including translations in Spanish and Farsi, will be published as part of The Big Balloon performances. In the Living Room, a post-performance discussion between Carreras, moderator, and audience link process to upbringings on Friday, April 14; on Saturday, April 15 a Wrap Party will follow.</p>
<p>The Big Balloon is part of the CURRENT SESSIONS’ 2017 curatorial focus “Resistance,” which looks to further classify movement into a broader spectrum by challenging systems of making and observing dance, and is first of a TCS-presented, solo-artist performance series.</p>

Doors were opened again and again always guided by her intuition and angels. Join her for a rich exploration into a life of transformation that can happen when you open your heat to art and listening to your angels.<br/>

			An aspiring camera operator finds herself on set for an indie fem-dom porno, starring and directed by bisexual “entreporneur” Gillian De Rey. Her co-star is Charlie, a pornstar facing disturbing allegations on social media. As they begin shooting, the audience and the camera operator become voyeurs in a morally ambiguous act of sexual violence. Kill Your Lovers is a video/play hybrid exploring the queer female gaze and the ethics of what turns us on.</p>

			Featuring Tova Katz</em><br/>
			Saturday 7/15, 7pm<br/>

With direction and choreography by Tricia Brouk, Tova Katz takes the audience on a twisted, howling, unforgettable ride. You only die once—don’t miss it!</p>
<p><em>Love Letters to Nobody, or Insignificant Others<br/>
			Featuring Maybe Burke</em><br/>
			Thursday 7/20, 7pm<br/>
<br/>
			“People hide real feelings in a lie they call love.” In this series of letters to and from their insignificant others, Maybe tells pieces of a story about how identity, love, sex, and trauma all influence each other. This moving solo show takes a multilayered look at abuse, happiness, disappointment and hope; all through the lens of love, and sometimes, the lack thereof. Maybe Burke is an award-winning New York based director, choreographer, writer, performer, and trans advocate telling the stories that have yet to be told in mainstream American theatre.</p>

<p>August 31-September 2 @ 8PM</p>
<p>NYC PREMIERE!</p>
<p>Jane Johnson for the Stay at Home Shopper is an original musical comedy that takes place over the span of one hour of Jane and her partner Pam Heller selling their accessories on the Stay at Home Shopper network, a channel not unlike QVC. The show features original songs, calls from viewers at home, and sweetly aggressive marketing techniques. The message is the same as Jane’s call to her fans: “Little Turtle, it’s time to come out of that shell!”</p>
<p>Jane (Shane O’Neill) and Pam (Jill Pangallo) of Mishepaqueniquamowoc, Wisconsin have been friends since childhood, but when Jane’s husband dies of a heart attack the same week that Pam’s husband leaves her for another woman, they need to depend on each other like never before. They end up making extra cash by crafting the small accessories line. What began as a table set up outside of their church selling Jane’s whimsical banana clips, has become a multi-million dollar empire with a loyal fan base of “Clipperchicks,” Jane’s nickname for the largely-Midwestern women who love her fun and festive aesthetic.</p>

<p>Ten Bones Theatre Company puts actors in front of a room full of drunks and demands that they recreate the stories of “Star Wars” entirely from memory. The show is cast blindly in front of the audience, and after that there are only three rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>They must incorporate lines written by the audience.</li>
<li>They must incorporate any sound effect played by the host.</li>
<li>One lucky audience member is given a horn that they may honk three times. Once honked, the performers must create a scene that makes perfect sense given where they are in the story but that has no business being in the story of Star Wars.</li>

<p>September 26-October 15</p>
<p>In Outside Paducah: The Wars at Home, written and performed by J. A. Moad II, we watch the toll of war reverberate across three generations of Americans: A seven year-old boy struggles to make sense of the screaming in the night after his father returns from Afghanistan. A fifty year-old man works to rebuild his life as he wrestles with the memory of an idealistic son—a teenager turned Marine who came back from Iraq wounded, disillusioned, and broken. And at a bar in the rust-belt remnant of his hometown, a former soldier’s midnight encounter brings the past and the present into an explosive, searing reality.</p>
<p><em>About J.A. Moad II</em><br/>

			IN FLIGHT<br/>
			In Flight mocks the market of mis-focusing information and our potential for mass apathy. It questions what it is as a species that allows us to look the other way. Its story draws from the insatiable hunger for distraction that subtly guides our attention away from the immediacy of larger, life-threatening issues.</p>
<p>SACRAMENT BURGER<br/>
			Sacrament-Burger focuses on our disconnection from the function and value of food and how that detachment contributes to the waste of nearly half of all food produced globally. It explores the inherent need to ritualize the act of eating and how this ceremony is performed within restaurant culture.</p>
