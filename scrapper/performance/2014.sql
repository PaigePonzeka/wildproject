<p class=\"showTitle\">The Way We Were 2.0</p>
<p>Curated by Jill Pangallo</p>
<p>Inspired by Jill Pangallo\'s stack of VHS’s full of cringe-inducing teenage antics, The Way We Were examines the relationship between the performer to their younger, digitized self and seeks to find currents of continuity between past and present artistic practices. Pangallo has invited a bevvy of talented, downtown, alternative cabaret performers to respond to a past video work of at least 15-years-old with a newly created live performance. Angsty, funny, sincere, sad, happy—and sometimes a mind-boggling combination of all of the above emotions—these early videos carry seeds of ideas and conventions employed in these artists\' now-honed works. In short, an evening of entertaining, new works that aim at synthesizing past and present selves.</p>

<p>Written &amp; Performed by Justin Sayre</p>
<p>The Boy Sonata, written in 5 parts, details seminal moments in the life of it’s central character, “The Boy.” Mimicking Sonata Form, the series of monologues follow \"the boy\" from ages 6 to 17. Each detail a day, an hour, a moment when things become much more beautifully and tragically complicated. The Boy Sonata is a heartbreakingly funny tribute to the voice of a child as he develops his individual understanding of a world.</p><p>JUSTIN SAYRE has been described by Michael Musto in The Village Voice as “Oscar Wilde meets Whoopi Goldberg” and by Edge New York’s Steve Weinstein as “Comedian, raconteur, performing artist, gay rights activist and sexual outlaw: I’m not sure Justin Sayre is classifiable. The veteran performer is on his way to becoming a Downtown Manhattan institution along the lines of Charles Ludlum or Charles Busch.” Most know for his hit comedy/variety show, The Meeting*, now in it’s 5th Season at 54 Below. The Meeting* has been hailed as “rambunctious, uproarious and unpredictable” by The Wall Street Journal, “delicious and delightfully droll” by The New York Post, and “hilarious and sardonic” by The Village Voice. Justin Sayre and The Meeting* were named one of the Top 10 nightclub shows of 2011 by Time Out New York, received the 2012 Bistro Award for “Comedy Artistry” and a 2011 MAC Award nomination for Best Male Comedy Performance.</p>
