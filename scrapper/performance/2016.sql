Day Trip is a series of extended-duration musical pieces – five (plus an installation) by Knight and three by TIGUE – stitched together into a continuous production. The works include live performances, pre-recorded compositions and sine-tone installations. Day Trip is highlighted by the world premiere of Knight’s Occultations, co-commissioned by Avant Media and TIGUE for the occasion. Occultations combines micro-robotic toys (HexBugs) with traditional percussion instruments (floor toms and cymbals), and an ever-changing counterpoint sine-tone drone accompanied by a fog and light show.</p>

The program features the world premiere of What Is The Word, based on Samuel Beckett’s last work. It also includes Ping (2014), also on a Beckett text, and A-R-S (2015), setting a Latin quote frequently cited by John Cage, an important influence: “ars imitatur naturam in sua operatione” (“art imitates nature in her manner of operation”). The hour-long performance of the three operas is preceded by a six-hour sound and light installation (noon - 6 pm,), based on the electronic component of A-R-S.</p>

Lasting between three and four hours, it is played by a sextet with voices and instruments, underpinned throughout by a harmonically complex drone rooted in a 72 hz (low ‘D’) fundamental tone. It is accompanied by a new video work by Gibson, Quadrilateral Starfield Symmetry A:L Base 11:273, consisting of luminous, slowly evolving geometrical forms that transform symmetrically along four axes.</p>

<p><img align=\"right\" alt=\"\" hspace=\"5\" src=\"http://localhost:3000/wp-content/themes/wildproject/images/performances/2016-AVANT-MUSIC-FESTIVAL-4.jpg\" vspace=\"5\"/>World premiere of composer/percussionist Jude Traxler’s virtuosic Blowback (and other mishaps), for percussion quartet and “roaming click track,” performed by Mangobot. Recreating digital effects through acoustic phenomena, each performer\'s computer-controlled click track moves ever so slightly to mimic reverb, flanger and reverse-delay effects live. As the piece plays out, these effects are varied and enhanced: very close relationships create stutter effects, while longer phase distances create sweeping reverb tails. This virtuosic work demands great concentration and rhythmic precision, and promises to deliver a rare sonic experience.</p>

The program features the world premiere of two new songs written especially for the performance. Naphtali’s themes include “technological angst, memories (past and future), machine codes, surveillance and the breakdown of communication.”</p>

<br/>
			Saturday night’s performance will feature an audience Q&amp;A, with special guest Tiger Tyson himself!</p>

			by Doug DeVita<br/>
			Friday 22nd, 7 pm; Saturday 23rd, 6:30 pm; Sunday 24th, 3:30 pm<br/>
<br/>

<p><em>Fire On Babylon</em><br/>
			by Michael Raver<br/>
			Tuesday 12th, 9 pm; Friday 15th, 6 pm; Sunday 17th, 5 pm<br/>
<br/>
			Two New Yorkers are locked in personal crisis, while the city is having one of its own: the 2003 blackout. Reclusive novelist Hugo Thomas has invited a beguiling young publishing intern to his downtown apartment. Within moments of their meeting it becomes clear to each that the other offers much more than meets the eye. When Hugo’s apartment is plunged into darkness, they connect in ways neither had imagined. Directed by Paul Mason Barnes</p>
<p><em>Watch Me Burn</em><br/>
			by Rae Binstock<br/>
			Tuesday 12th, 7 pm; Wednesday 13th, 7 pm; Thursday 14th, 9 pm<br/>
<br/>
			Prometheus “Methe” Graham, a young black New York City firefighter, is determined to rely on herself and no one else. But the heat is rising: the stresses of her mother’s recent death, her teenage sister’s rebellion, her captain’s doubts, and the disapproval of her Harlem neighbors create an ongoing psychic holocaust that threatens to consume her from within. There are those, like Methe’s unexpected lover Sophia or her firehouse buddy Andre, who try but cannot penetrate her self-selected isolation; nor, when the times comes, can they spare her the revenge taken by the flames she has fought so hard to conquer.</p>
<p><em>Where’s Hope? Where’s Hope? Oh, God, Where’s Hope?</em><br/>
			By Frederick Kirwin. Directed by Paul Navarra.<br/>
			Thursday 21st, 7 pm; Saturday 23rd, 8:30 pm; Sunday 24th, 1:30 pm<br/>
<br/>
			Over the course of thirty years our perceptions of the past change. A love triangle, a midnight storytelling, a drowning, and a murder/suicide may not be what they seem. Set in Florida of the 1960s, Frederik Kirwin’s poetic play is a sometimes comic discourse on revenge, pride, ambition, jealousy, wanderlust, sibling rivalry, sexual innocence, reversal of fortunes, and a baseball game.</p>

<p>For the 11th edition of the CURRENT SESSIONS’ biannual performance series, artists across contemporary movement will present works as part of Volume VI, Issue II: MOVEMENT CURRENCY, held Friday, August 19 to Sunday, August 21, 2016 at the wild project.</p>
<p>MOVEMENT CURRENCY will focus on how bodies produce, exchange, and perform within systems of value, drawing on figurative and ethnographic practices to consider the lineage of choreographies which qualify our social identity. Presented as four distinct programs: Risk, Debt, Savings, and Credit, MOVEMENT CURRENCY incorporates somatic and improvisational practices, as well as works examining personal movement histories, blackness, queerness, and cultural memory.</p>
<p><em>PROGRAMMING SCHEDULE</em></p>
<p><em>01 RISK // Friday, August 19, 2016 at 7:30pm</em><br/>
			From fragility to preservation, harm to survival, an evening of work developing risk as a performative dimension which trades personal safety for choreographic opportunity. With artists Amanda Hunt, Ben Hagari (film), Bobbi Jene Smith, Jessica Pretty, and Katrina Reid.</p>
<p><em>02 DEBT // Saturday, August 20, 2016 at 7:30pm</em><br/>
			Choreographing obligation, dances articulating indebtedness to history and those which play on debts of expectation. With artists Amanda Hunt, Brendan Drake, Gregory Holt, Jasmine Hearn (film), Tara Aisha Willis.</p>
<p><em>03 SAVINGS // Sunday, August 21, 2016 at 3:00pm with Talkback</em><br/>
			When the dance is done, what remains? Toward a performative archive for memory, ancestry, and ritual. With artists Ben Hagari (film), Bobbi Jene Smith, Fana Fraser, Gregory Holt, Katrina Reid.</p>
<p><em>04 CREDIT // Sunday, August 21, 2016 at 7:00pm</em><br/>
			In search of movement provenance. Works acknowledging impression and influence, tracing lineage and locating cultural ownership. With artists Brendan Drake, Fana Fraser, Jasmine Hearn (film), Jessica Pretty, Tara Aisha Willis.</p>

<p>The leopard is an apex predator: powerful, adaptable, and challenging to domesticate. Leopard print is an apex fashion statement: powerful, controversial, and difficult to ignore. As changes in the production and distribution of fashion have occurred, as well as changes in the agency of women and the restrictions of class and economy, people have had the ability to express themselves through clothing in ways unprecedented in history. A pattern evolved in nature to help a predator blend in has become a phenomenon developed in culture to make a woman stand out. Come to this lecture to learn about leopard print as a signifier in popular culture, and its meanings as sifted through the lenses of entertainment, social change, and feminism.</p>

The photos display the result of another crime, an act of traffic violence that happened when driver Yosef Lifsh careened onto the sidewalk and killed a young boy named Gavin Cato on August 19, 1991. Güler was present for the funeral, and captured the grief and pain of the community in the midst of the Crown Heights riots.</p>

<p>Set in 1930’s Chicago, a Tony Soprano/Al Capone-like figure named Arturo Ui, is a crazy but totally charismatic gangster bent on gaining power at all costs in this wickedly funny and savage satire of the rise of a fascist dictator. Join us for this wildly entertaining farce that ultimately turns frighteningly relevant, Brecht utilizes a wide range of parody and pastiche – from Capone to Shakespeare’s Richard III and Goethe’s Faust.</p>
<p>Phoenix Theatre Ensemble will be presenting the U.S. premiere of the celebrated recent translation by Stephen Sharkey (\"stiletto sharp\" – The Guardian). Sharkey was quoted in 2011 \"I think in the epilogue, Brecht acknowledges that the world fought back and got rid of this threat, this dreadful tyrant [Hitler]. But with the final line – the beast that bore him is in heat again – that’s Brecht’s warning.\"</p>

<p>Eugene O\'Neill\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning drama Anna Christie tells the story of a young woman’s struggle for redemption and a chance at a new life. Harboring a troubling secret from her past, Anna reunites with her father - a captain, a master of the sea, and a man she hardly knows. As the wild and dangerous waters would have it, Anna meets a shipwrecked young sailor and the two fall in love. When she finds she can no longer hide her past from the two men in her life, the bonds of love are tested. A powerful and relevant retelling of O\'Neill\'s masterpiece, the play continues to challenge our understanding of honor and dignity.</p>
