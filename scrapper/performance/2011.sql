<h2 class=\"firstheader\">synopsis:</h2>
<p>The show is the sequence of 15 landscapes composed by performative actions where a man and a woman tell their relationship with the contemporary world which is in continuous evolution.</p>
<p>
From love affair to politics, the human gesture is the key to read the complexity of social relationships in which the characters get lost during their constant pursuit of balance. </p>
<p>
The music and the plasticity of the bodies make this show, which has a strong visual impact, very close to the performative arts.</p>
<p>
The show is produced, directed and played by Dario La Stella and Valentina Solinas who in 2002 founded the company Senza Confini Di Pelle in Torino, Italia.</p>', '15_Landscapes', '2018-05-06 15:06:27', '2018-05-06 15:06:27', '2018-05-06 15:06:27', '2018-05-06 15:06:27', 1, 'publish','performancearchive');

<p><em>ATTA BOY</em> follows Homer, a middle-aged Pakistani-American engineer, and Matthew, a surly teenaged outcast, as they meet for secret rendezvous at a local holiday inn. This is no ordinary affair.</p>
<p>
The play is a collage performance, and incorporates original writing with re-appropriated transcripts from contemporary journalism, youtube videos, conservative christian weblogs, torture theory and practice, and popular cultural representations of the Columbine Massacre and the attacks at the World Trade Center in New York City in 2001. <em>ATTA BOY</em> conflates the xenophobia/homophobia in the national responses to these traumatic historical moments, and maps a creepy topography of vulnerable desire.</p>

<p>What is the difference between performance art burlesque, neo burlesque and classic burlesque? Ah the question of the century! In Performance Art Burlesque at The New York School of Burlesque students learned that performance art is easily and often accidentally integrated into what we know as Neo-Burlesque. International Performance Art Star and Burlesque Queen Darlinda Just Darlinda curated this series focusing on the alternative, narrative, humorous, political, queer, and quirky side of neo-burlesque. The students created acts that are bound to entertain shock and excite the most artsy-fartsy performance lovers! </p>

<p>Rob Roth and Marti Domination</p>
<p>Rob Roth and Marti Domination present an evening of <em>NIGHTVISION</em> at The Wild Project.</p>
<p>Marti sings songs of dark glamour with \"Beaut\" featuring electric guitarist Paul Twinkle, and Rob Roth continues his Wolfboy performance with Cellist Chad Hammer. Roth\'s Wolfboy is a study in shapeshifting, a developing piece that evokes old shadows by revealing New Wave songs as Requiems. In her self-penned laments, Marti\'s Beaut dives right to the bottom of the ashtray and crawls back up with a black eye, wrapped in a fishnet glow.</p>
<p><em>NIGHTVISION</em> is an experimental dreamscape that continues their former collaborations in clandestine surveillance.</p>
<p>New York City-born director and visual artist Rob Roth\'s work draws from photography, video, painting and dramaturgy to create experiences that blend media and performance to present a lyrical spectacle. His work has been exhibited at a variety of venues including the New Museum for Contemporary Art, Performance Space122, Abrons Art Center, Galapagos Art Space, and Deitch Projects as well as the Whitney Museum of American Art.</p>
<p>Marti Domination is an actress and dancer who has starred in such films as Matthew Barney\'s \"Cremaster 1\". She worked extensively with the Blacklips Performance Cult alongside Antony (of Antony and the Johnsons). She has also performed at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, Museum für Gegenwartskunst Basel, and most recently at Participant Gallery in \"Dead Flowers\". </p>', 'NIGHTVISION', '2018-05-06 15:06:29', '2018-05-06 15:06:29', '2018-05-06 15:06:29', '2018-05-06 15:06:29', 1, 'publish','performancearchive');

<h2 class=\"firstheader\">synopsis:</h2>
<p><em>The Tragedy of Maria Macabre</em> is a theatrical dance piece inspired by 19th century European Circus imagery, silent horror films, and el Dia de los Muertos. The story begins at the end of the life of our twisted heroine, Miss Macabre. Upon dying, Maria Macabre is not granted eternal slumber, but instead a whirling, kaleidoscopic carnival of horrors: a morbid funhouse where humanity is stripped away and a permanent place in the gruesome chorus line is all but assured. Arriving in the land of the dead, Maria Macabre is greeted by the King and the Queen of the Dead, and many other ghoulish Hades-Dwellers including a maniacal Ringmistress, a Beauty Queen burnt to a crisp, a menacing French Clown, and three skeletal Mariachis.</p>
<p>RKP Theater Ensemble’s haunting dance piece <em>The Tragedy of Maria Macabre</em> will feature Preston Burger (lead dancer The Forms “Fire To The Ground” music video), Danielle Marie Fusco (Joyce Soho; Martha Graham Repertory), Abigail Hawk (Baker in “Blue Bloods” on CBS), Danny Mendoza, Megan O’Connor, Ethan O’Hara, Scooter Pie (Co-host, Shaken and Stirred Burlesque), Michael Porsche, Brian Rubiano, Eric Schmalenberger (House of Yes; The Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black), and Elizabeth Stewart (The Hunter and the Swan Discuss Their Meeting at Sundance). The production is conceived, designed and choreographed by New York Innovative Theatre Award nominated directed and choreographer Rachel Klein (Circus of Circus at The House of Yes). The creative team will include Costume Design by Rachel Klein and Kae Burke (Winner of the 2011 New York Innovative Theatre Award for Innovative Design), Sound Design by Sean Gill, Lighting Design by Ben Kato, Calligraphy Design by Pak Kei Mak, Feather Design by Ashley Morgan Monroe, Makeup Design by Anita Rundles and Costume Construction by Make Fun Studios.

<h2 class=\"firstheader\">synopsis:</h2>
<p>The Current Sessions was conceived in July 2011 to bring like-minded contemporary choreographers together and present work that is in-the-moment and reflective of our current state of mind and process. To this end, all works are created and presented within a time period of six weeks. We are interested in producing detailed works that are fresh, raw, experimental and curious; we want to provide our audience with a glimpse of what dance is right now, and with what dance will be in its future state.</p>
<p>We all have the desire to develop our own voices as choreographers in a comfortable environment where spontaneity, openness and the instinctive nature of creation are valued.</p>
<p>This edition of The Current Sessions will include work from the \"originals\" Alexis Convento, Yin Yue, Jonathan Royse Windham, Allison Jones and Genna Baroni, as well as, a new slew of like-minded individuals such as: Jenna Otter (Mon 11/28 only), Jordan Isadore, Bennyroyce Royon, and MADboots dance/Jonathan Campbell (Tues 11/29 only)... how exciting!</p>

<p><em>\"Modeh Ani - I Give Thanks\"</em> is a dance expression of a Jewish prayer that is recited daily upon waking. <em>\"L’Chaim - To Life!\"</em> celebrates the survival and flourish of Jewish existence after the Holocaust.  The movement is a fusion of Israeli folk and Tap dance, creating a unique new style.  We remember.  We survive. We celebrate.  We dance. <em>\"Hashkiveinu – Lay us Down\"</em> is an artistic expression of a Jewish prayer in which we ask G-d\'s help to lie down in peace at night and to return to life each morning.  Each tap beat represents a star appearing in the sky. <em>\"Salaam – Peace\"</em> explores the theme of universal peace.  Dance is used to join together as one in a community of harmony.<br/>

<h2 class=\"firstheader\">synopsis:</h2>
<p>Pink Light Burlesque is a project that provides free classes for breast cancer patients and survivors.</p>
<p>December 4th is our first showcase, featuring students and instructors of this program, in association with <a href=\"http://www.youcanthrive.org/\" target=\"_blank\">You Can Thrive</a>.</p>
<p>The show will be dedicated to our friend Diane Naegel, who was hoping to perform as part of the project but lost her battle with breast cancer due to complications on September 25. Our hearts go out to her and her friends and family, and to all others experiencing the same struggle.</p>
<p>Burlesque celebrates the human drive to amuse, provoke, charm, and seduce. The goal of the Pink Light Burlesque project is to invite survivors to take classes to experience the joyous and body-loving fun so many burlesque students embrace. For those who would like to perform, we hope to create a performing troupe of burlesque dancers made up of breast cancer patients and survivors (and a few of their allies). If they wish to continue beyond the classes, these dancers may perform professionally as well as to benefit charity and fund raising events.</p>
<p>We want to give these students the benefit of working with our resources. As one of the longest-running burlesque schools in the world, we have benefited hugely from the international burlesque community, and we want to share that network with people who are experiencing the challenges of cancer treatment and recovery.</p>
<p>We will be running free classes for breast cancer patients and survivors during the months of October and November. Please contact us to findout how to participate. If you are interested in helping, taking classes, or performing, email <a href=\"mailto:pinklight@schoolofburlesque.com\">pinklight@schoolofburlesque.com</a>.</p>
