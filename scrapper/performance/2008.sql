<p>The controversial play that shocked the UK.</p>
<p>Stu and Abby love each other so madly, they\'re driving each other crazy.
 Stitching follows the increasingly disturbing and inventive games the couple
 plays in order to connect. As they circle and test each other, they role-play
 with reality and fantasy to the point where even they don\'t seem sure what is
 real anymore. When Abby discovers she\'s pregnant, the choices they make will
 haunt them forever. The visceral poetry and physicality between the lovers
 creates a surprisingly tender, often humorous, brutal romance. Stitching is a
 complex love story that takes a bracing look at the startling casualties of
 modern romance.
 \"Anthony Neilson\'s Stitching is one of the most exciting plays of the year I
 left the theatre with my pulse, and my mind racing.\" - Time Out London</p>

<p>Written and performed by Michael Cavadias<br/>
		Directed by Rob Roth</p> 
<p>For thousands of years, there has been a raging debate about the validity of the Claywoman Hypothesis. A 500,000,000 year old enigma who, legend has it, can cure anyone of their deepest pain. The last remaining evidence we have is \"The Mystery of Claywoman\", an unfinished documentary  discovered in a low income housing unit on the lower east side. In it we hear from a Scientist who thinks the entire idea is ludicrous, an old woman who has been waiting for Claywoman for 30 years, two lesbian intellectuals who have written a book on Claywoman, as well as others who claim to actually know Claywoman personally.</p>

<img src=\"/performances/http://localhost:3000/wp-content/themes/wildproject/images/performances/sponsors200810.gif\" style=\"margin-top:60px;\"/>

<p>Great Scott Films Inc. and Megan Bienstock present  Abandoned Stillness. Abandoned  Stillness is bi-annual festival blending different art forms and media into one evening.  The current presentation of Abandoned Stillness features the debut of the play, <i>This Is Way Beyond My Remote Control</i>, written by Megan Bienstock. 
Directed by Mahayana Landowne.</p>
<p><i>This is Way Beyond my Remote Control</i>, is a vivid and adventurous theatrical work that is a moving exploration of love, loss, and what remains; all entangled in a collision of memories and reality. 
The plays mixture of visual allure and emotional clarity; grants us access to the actual experience of letting go of love.</p>
<p>The evening also presents two mind expansive animated short films by the animator/ Graffiti Artist Sam3.
His work is sometimes ironic, other times poetic, but consistently thought provoking. 
Sam 3s films explore the idea that there is no beginning or end, only a constant shape shifting continuous existence. </p>
