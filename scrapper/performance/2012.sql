<p>Written by Takeo Rivera, directed by Alex Mallory<br/>
Featuring Samantha Cooper, Dontonio Demarco, Natalia Duong, Edgar Eguia, Kenneth Heaton, Monique Paige and Nabil Viñas<br/>
<br/>Today, as the American military returns home from Iraq and we as a society are trying to comprehend what kind of footprint we\'ve left behind, Goliath provides a way to look deeper into what we do during times of war, what behavior becomes excusable, and what it means to love when violence is part of the norm.<br/>
<br/>Earlier this year, Goliath had a critically acclaimed run at the Planet Connection Festivity where it received numerous awards including Outstanding Overall Production. Director Alex Mallory (winner, Outstanding Direction) returns to remount Rivera’s heartbreaking and intense spoken-word piece.<br/>
<br/>“Goliath is one of the rare gifts that theatre bestows upon us — powerful and passionately produced, raising important questions about the world we live in today.” — nytheatre.com<br/>
<br/>“As beautifully rendered by Rivera, Mallory, and an excellent cast, Goliath is fresh, honestly emotional, heartbreaking, and true.” — Show Showdown<br/>

<p>A Choreodrama by Zoë Flowers<br/>
Directed by Chinasa Ogbuagu<br/>
Featuring Peggy Johnson, Sherri Pullum, Chantal Maurice and Vesta Walker<br/>
<br/>Based on Zoë Flowers\' Dirty Laundry, a series of candid interviews with women of color who had experienced domestic and sexual violence, From Ashes to Angel\'s Dust: A Journey Through Womanhood (FA2AD) is a choreodrama that uses monologues; poetry and vignettes to address these issues and provide a forum for discussion and activism through art.<br/>
<br/>The Ashes Manifesto:<br/>
From Ashes to Angel\'s Dust: A Journey Through Womanhood is for our ancestors that died so that we might live-that starved so we might prosper. It is for those silenced by violence, oppression, homophobia, shame or the impulse to please. This play is for little girls that grow into women looking for fathers in the arms of strange men. It\'s for all those who ask \"why does she stay.\" This show is for women who recognize that protection, unconditional love and unconditional freedom can occupy the same space. For all who understand that loving another and one\'s self is a revolutionary act- the most revolutionary act. In short, From Ashes to Angel\'s Dust is for complicated, simple, uncompromising, weak, independent, gold-digging, hardworking, hard loving, bitchy, vulnerable, strong, happy, and angry women and all those that choose to love us. <br/>

Directed by Jesse Y. Jou, Performed by Aizzah Fatima, Yalinidream, &amp; Kelly Zen-Yie Tsai, Dramaturgy by Amissa Miller<br/>
<br/>SAY YOU HEARD MY ECHO is an evening-length spoken word poetry theater project that juxtaposes fictional narratives of three Asian American women in NYC a decade after 9/11. Their struggles with survivorship and faith prompt them to call on three female religious icons (Mary Magdalene, Guan Yin, and Aisha) for solace and answers as they come of age in a world impacted by war. Rendered with humor and humanity, SAY YOU HEARD MY ECHO questions what remains sacred in times of war while unearthing intersections between feminism, Asian Pacific Islander American identity, and religious freedom.<br/>

<p>By Kenneth Lonergan</p>
<p>Growing up in New York City in 1982 was a rushed affair. Drugs, junkies, and a severe recession all exposed New Yorkers early on to the grim realities of life. There was a lot to worry about back then and for the wealthy few there was usually enough money to shield themselves and their children from the city\'s worst offenses. But purchasing power has its limits. \"This Is Our Youth\" is the story of three young adults who discover that the one thing their parents\' money can\'t protect is the one thing they\'re desperately hoping to hold on to forever. </p>', 'This_Is_Our_Youth', '2018-05-06 15:06:20', '2018-05-06 15:06:20', '2018-05-06 15:06:20', '2018-05-06 15:06:20', 1, 'publish','performancearchive');

<p class=\"showTitle\">Happy Go Sad</p>
<p>By Jill Pangallo </p>
<p>In her latest multimedia, persona-based performance <em>Happy Go Sad</em>, Jill Pangallo re-creates the compound and often incongruous roles that people perform on a daily basis. Pangallo’s detailed, nuanced portraits oscillate between emotional and emotive polarities—funny and serious, happy and sad, tribute and observation—and endeavor to highlight what she believes to be an epidemic of denial and lack of self-awareness, both on a personal and public level, in the U.S. Universally familiar models and tropes—broadcast advertising, industrial videos and mainstream dance, amongst others—are referenced and subverted as Pangallo continues to explore the crossover between art and entertainment, as well the way humor functions within this interchange. Happy Go Sad employs a deceptively naïve aesthetic that purposefully highlights the performative rather than the technical, and leaves the audience floating in the liminal, and sometimes lonely, space between fantasy and reality.</p>', 'Happy_Go_Sad', '2018-05-06 15:06:20', '2018-05-06 15:06:20', '2018-05-06 15:06:20', '2018-05-06 15:06:20', 1, 'publish','performancearchive');

<p class=\"showTitle\">WILD MAN IN ROME</p>
<p>Written and Performed by Matthew Maguire<br/>
<br/>Produced by Creation Production Company</p>
<p>The Wild Man is pursued through Rome by the Devil who has come to collect! Calling upon the Meditations of Marcus Aurelius, the blues classic, Hellhound On My Trail by Robert Johnson, and the sex slang of Shakespeare, the Wild Man inhabits disguises to throw Il Diavolo off his scent, including a woeful Italian saint, San Desolato, and Padraic Murphy, a ragged Shakespearean busker who recites to the Devil. WILD MAN IN ROME asks: Where is our wild side and how can we unleash it?</p>
<p>In 2010 Matthew Maguire performed a solo play called WILD MAN. In it, he grappled with mortality as he explored the wildest moments of his life. True stories of runaway horses, smuggling watermelons, and cheating death met with enthusiastic response from audiences in NY and LA. Now he returns with fresh stories collected in Rome over four years. Whereas the original version was 100% true, Wild Man in Rome interweaves fact with fantasy.</p>', 'WILD_MAN_IN_ROME', '2018-05-06 15:06:26', '2018-05-06 15:06:26', '2018-05-06 15:06:26', '2018-05-06 15:06:26', 1, 'publish','performancearchive');
