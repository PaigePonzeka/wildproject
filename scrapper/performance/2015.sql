<p>Avant Media presents the complete World premiere of Nate Wooley’s evening-length for Kenneth Gaburo, scored for trumpet and pre-recorded electronic sound and performed by the composer. Using Wooley’s research in the mechanical production of phonetic sound and its effect on tonal production, the work stretches an introductory text by electronic music pioneer and language theorist Gaburo (1926 - 93) until the component phonemes lose their connection to textual meaning and become pure sound.</p>

<p>Written and performed by Sarah Jane Johnson, directed by Patrice Miller<br/>
<br/>
			Produced by All for One Theater</p>
<p>The summer of a lifetime for a small town girl from Nebraska, a chance to study overseas, changes the trajectory of her life forever. A weekend in Paris with friends that ends before it begins, a young woman finds herself in a hospital, an empty shell of who she used to be. After days spent with police and detectives, her assailant jailed, she begins the next chapter of her life: the trial of her rapist.</p><p>Sarah Jane takes us on her journey of the successful prosecution, and dealing with the intangible concept of justice, discovers that a conviction does not heal her wounds. With honesty, redemptive humor, and a 24-ounce can of Miller Lite, she purges her experiences of post-traumatic stress disorder, HIV prevention medication, depression, and alcohol abuse. Through tales of Internet dating and the navigation through a foreign legal system by someone who can’t even order a sandwich in French, we find liberation to laugh in spite of it all.</p>

			The 6@6 Reading Series brings in six new poetic works from artists not only in New York, but throughout the country. The reading series allows playwrights the ability to have their work read and workshopped in the time leading up to the festival where they then have a lightly staged reading allowing the playwright to see how an audience reacts to their work. Readings that have been performed in previous festivals have been written by Kelly Zen-Yie Tsai, Darian Dauchan, and Craig ‘muMs’ Grant.</p>
<p><em>Generation Now!</em><br/>
			Saturday February 8th at 3PM is the 3rd Annual showcase of youth voices featuring new poetic work including coming-of-age stories &amp; perspectives on the world as 2020 approaches by youth participating in viBe Theater Experience, Girl Be Heard, Dare Tactic, and Earsay Youth Voices.</p>
<p><em>About the Organizations:</em></p>
<p><em>viBe Theater Experience:</em><br/>
			Original theater and music about real-life issues written and performed by New York City teenage girls. viBe’s intensive, free programs engage, inspire and empower girls (ages 13-19) to write, create, publish, direct and perform personal and truthful collaborative theater and music about the real-life issues they face daily. viBe provides a safe, creative space for girls to express their voices, take on challenges and gain the self-confidence necessary to succeed personally, artistically and academically. Since 2002, more than 60 viBe productions have brought free theater, live musical performances, music videos and radio plays to thousands of diverse audience members, changing their perceptions about the kind of art that young women can create.</p>
<p><em>Girl Be Heard:</em><br/>
			Girl Be Heard uses theater as a vehicle to empower young women to become brave, confident, socially conscious leaders while exploring their own challenging circumstances. Girl Be Heard is a not-for-profit theater collective and educational program. Their curriculum develops and strengthens girls\' voices. They provide a safe environment to girls to write, direct, and perform theater productions under the guidance of professional directors, playwrights, actors, activists, and intellectuals. Girl Be Heard\'s school and community-based programs engage company members - young women age 12-21- through a series of writing prompts, readings, theatre exercises and discussions addressing a variety of issues that have included identity (race, class, sexual orientation, ability), body image, suicide, teen pregnancy, substance abuse, gun violence, sex trafficking, forced child marriage, violence against women and girls, and civil and human rights. The Girl Be Heard philosophy is \"If a girl can change her own life, she can change the lives of girls everywhere.\"</p>
<p><em>Dare Tactic:</em><br/>
			The Dare Tactic is a creative group with the mission of cultivating creativity in all forms. We \"dare\" each other to do the work we want to see. We kicked off the year with sold out performances of our original production HOPELESS written and directed by Vinny Eden Ortega.</p>
<p><em>EarSay Youth Voices: Transforming Trauma Into Art:</em><br/>
			EarSay Youth Voices is a non-profit arts organization based in Queens, NY. The program was founded by actress/writer/radio producer Judith Sloan, born out of EarSay’s partnership with the International High School at LaGuardia Community College where many teenagers have emigrated to the U.S. from war-zones and conflict-zones. The premise of their workshops is based on healing through artistic expression using a combination of music, movement, theatre, storytelling and radio production. This process helps release the stories and stressors that prevent people—who have been traumatized by war, economic or natural disasters—from moving forward. This program brings an understanding of confronting obstacles through artistic expression to communities that are poor, displaced, or don’t have access to artistic training, serving approximately 450 students. The project grows out of the commitment to creating artistic works that evolve out of individual experience and community. In this case, the community is immigrant and refugee teenagers attending school in New York City. At a time of war, global tension, and polarization, their program encourages a depth of scholarship and storytelling that shapes the experience of the participants, giving them tools to make connections between cultures, and shed light on the complexity and humanity of each individual, and deepen what it means or could mean to be part of a global community.</p>
<p><em>Love, Redefined</em><br/>
			Saturday February 14th (Valentines Day) at 8PM<br/>
			Poetic Theater Productions’ fifth annual celebration of non-commercial, non-traditional love featuring poetic and theatrical remixes, re-imaginings and riffs by more than ten incredible poets &amp; playwrights responding to traditional sonnets and love poems. Inspiration poems and newly developed pieces are presented side-by-side. Previous years included inspiration pieces by William Shakespeare, Pablo Neruda, Ghandi, Audre Lorde, John Donne, George Herbert, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, e. e. cummings and more.<br/>
			Directed by Andrew Willis-Woodward and Dontonio Demarco<br/>
			Featuring new work by Reginald Flood, Catherine Weingarten, Dipika Guha, Gina Femia<br/>
			(Several Additional Writers TBA)<br/>
			Cast TBA</p>
<p><em>Breaking Our Silence</em><br/>
			February 20, 2015 at 8:00pm A celebration of LBGTQ voices sharing their experiences of coming out, finding love, breaking the silence and speaking out!<br/>
<br/>
			Written by and featuring: Ty Defoe, Timothy DuWhite, Sentell Harper, Joanna Hoffman, Sam Laroche, Charan P. Morris and Storm Thomas<br/>
			Director: Daniel Banks<br/>
<br/>
			\"This year\'s edition of Breaking Our Silence focuses on thriving. The performers have worked together durig a brief workshop period to link their narratives of how they got to the present moment and where they are going. While it is critical to acknowledge the struggles and oppressions we all face, we also celebrate our successes and the fact that we make the choice to thrive and survive! We hope our stories will inspire others.\" -Danial Banks, director</p>

<p><em>THE LEARS: Fools of Fortune</em> – World Premiere<br/>
<br/>
			By Patrick Thomas McCarthy. Suggested by Shakespeare’s KING LEAR, this contemporary American telling has Alzheimers-addled Captain of Industry, Edgar Reginald Lehman Lear, gathering those closest to him for an advance reading of the will at Thanksgiving dinner. Homicide, a blinding, poisonings, betrayal, abuse, sibling rivalries, cross dressing, arm wrestling (and even loyalty, redemption &amp; love!) find their way into the turbulent mix. Anyone who has experienced “family” will appreciate this work.<br/>

<p><em>BLUE FIRE ON THE WATER</em> – A Memory Play with Music and Multi-media<br/>
<br/>
			“Can‘t go backwards if you gon play the song right”<br/>
<br/>
			What happens when our shelter, cars, clothes, loves – every instrument we use to connect our lives or shield ourselves from the pains of this world – are scattered and swept away? Set in New Orleans, the play opens just after Katrina’s rage and the flood begins. It spans 60 years exploring the love triangle of two Blues musicians and their manager. This piece speaks to musicians, African Americans, the aging, and anyone who has loved. As hurricane Katrina lashes New Orleans, and the flood waters rise, blues singer Joe reflects on the love he lost years back when he refused that time too to leave his home. A story of love and betrayal, with a bow to the real life travails of jazz artist Billy Tipton (who lived as a man although she was a woman). What has been called “vibrant, poetic writing intermingled with The Blues” will take the audience on an amazing personal journey.<br/>

<p><em>TELLING</em> – “Hope is a strange invention” - Emily Dickenson<br/>
<br/>
			A new play by critically acclaimed novelist Natalie Bates. The battle between love and fear, played out in a Chicago suburb of 1972. Two women, married with grown children, have discovered, to their astonishment, that they have fallen in love. So much more than a period piece, this “honest, lyrical account of the cost of loving” captures their journey to wrench free of conventional obligations and carve a space to live out their love.<br/>

			A famous Broadway composer locks himself away in the small inn he built and managed with his now deceased lover. A feisty young journalist hoping to interview the reclusive composer comes to the inn. With demons of her own to manage, could she be a possible agent of redemption? But known only to the audience, the lover’s spirit haunts the inn, and everything is fair game in the verbal confrontations to follow – old memories, painful secrets, and a very dramatic and cathartic conclusion.

<p>by Jo Weldon</p>
<h2 class=\"firstheader\">showtimes:</h2>
<p>September 3 @ 8PM</p>
<p>This is the premier presentation of HarperCollins author Jo Weldon\'s research into the history of leopard print! This segment will feature predominantly the past 100 years in the US, with a focus on how leopard print has been worn as people of all genders have had unprecedented opportunities to express themselves through fashion; however, the origin of the pattern will be traced from the lands where the cats themselves originate, and how it has been used before becoming a fashion print, and how that informs its current significance. (How does this pattern relate from Zulu culture to Lisa Frank? Seriously!) It\'s partly a light-hearted romp through cultural iconography, partly an examination of feminism, civil rights, gender, class, and fashion technology. Attendees will get a sense of the history, depth and meaning in the common things around them.</p>

<p>Special event: Exploring the experience of refugees and migrants in the Mediterranean<br/>
<br/>
			On Tuesday Sept 8th Between the Seas, in partnership with the UNGUARDED Collective, will organize a series of events and open discussions dedicated to exploring the experience of migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean region and discussing methods of empowering their voice.</p>

			Free event. Presented in English<br/>
			The play tells the parallel stories of 2 generations of migrants, from the countryside to the periphery of the urban centers and from there to the European metropolis. The harsh reality of urbanization, illegal migration, the riots in the French suburbs, are intertwined with the comic relief of TV personas and gypsies, in this bitter-sweet play, \" a festive and colourful painting, a bubble of tenderness in a dark reality\" (Nicolas Arnstam)</p>

			N∙CITE? is a interdisciplinary performance developed by the UNGUARDED collective in collaboration with Mohammad Mirzay, a refugee, human rights advocate and member of the Afghani community in Athens, Greece. In this work, the collective focuses its exploration on the power of knowledge, the ability to communicate and the importance of empowering one\'s own voice. The UNGUARDED collective aims to raise public awareness about the personal and legal challenges, living in detention, day to day and/or homeless, that refugees experience in Greece and Southern Europe.</p>

<p><em>7pm:</em> Dreams of the Mediterranean (Catalonia)<br/>
			A multi disciplinary show combining sand art, live music, puppetry and speed painting. The illustrator, Borja González, works on a lit glass table top, sand-drawing onto the live music played by pianist Roc Sala. A camera records and projects the action on a big screen in real time so that we are able to follow the fascinating creative process of each drawing, which makes us travel to well-known corners of the world, natural environments which sing to the poetic nature of the human geography. Borja Gonzáles talent allows him to offer -in between his mesmerizing drawings- challenging acrobatics and he even manages to end the show very tenderly with the help of a life-size puppet.</p>

			“A Masterpiece of claustrophobia, an exploration of despotism, delusion and power games” (Daily Star, Lebanon), The Dictator, written in 1969 by Issam Mahfouz, tells the story of a tyrant, a mentally disturbed individual under the illusion that he is humanity\'s long-awaited saviour. With the present turmoil in the Middle East in mind, the company revives this Lebanese classic of absurdism in a minimalist staging, in its new English translation by Robert Myers.</p>

			Acclaimed Catalan playwright Angels Aymar collaborates with NYC based actors for Hearts Beating Like Drums, a play built around women and war. 3 actresses embody different characters and their stories as victims of destruction, fight and fear. The scenes deal with the consequences of the disaster and the dysfunction which come from it.</p>

<p><em>2pm:</em> The Dictator (Lebanon</p>
<p><em>6.30pm:</em> Influx (USA/Lebanon) / Per...Inciso (Italy) (double bill)<br/>
			Transition between cultures. Dance moves between. Masses crossing borders. Influx is the cross-cultural dance collaboration between Nadra Assaf (Lebanon) and Rain Ross (USA), with music composed by Martin Loyato (Argentina). Dancers from the USA and Lebanon perform with live musicians from Lebanon, showcasing narratives of community and exchange, of fluidity and discovery.<br/>
<br/>
			Italian songs of the 60s and 90s are the protagonist in Per...Inciso, a sparkling, entrertaining work by one of Italy\'s most up and coming companies. From Modugno to Sinatra, from De Andrè to Gaber, from Capossela to Jovanotti the 7 dancers bring together, using irony and humour, different generations with sometimes similar experiences and emotions.<br/>
<br/>
			The company uses its signature style of combining a variety of genres – hip hop, contemporary etc -- to reconcile-young and old, tradition and innovation with a new, personal, dramaturgical language, lightweight and profound at the same time.</p>

<p>Privatopia, by M. Eustathiades (Greece)<br/>
			Free event. Presented in English. (Part of the Special Event: exploring the experience of migrants and refugees in the Mediterranean)<br/>
			Written in 2013, in an absurdist style characteristic of the playwright\'s aesthetic, the play is centered around a gated community, the Ones Inside the Wall, feeling increasingly threatened by The Ones Outside the Wall, migrants and homeless people. Eustathiadis makes a grotesque commentary on the increasing fears of Europe\'s upper classes in the face of the \'other\'.</p>

<p>Rough Draft, a powerful and compelling theater piece utilizing movement as its primary vocabulary, tells the story of an established novelist for whom a tragic event serves as a catalyst for self examination. Having believed his life was a well written book, he must question and redefine for himself what it means to be \"successful\" and discover if he possesses the courage to begin anew, another “rough draft.\"</p>

			As part of the spring 2013 Art Monastic Laboratory, three Artmonks hosted a series of interviews with the people of Acaya, an extremely small town in southern Italy. The interviews revolved around questions of personal and cultural transformation, stories from the past, and hopes for the future. From the overarching themes, day-to-day feelings, and actual footage gleaned from those interviews and the region of Puglia, the Artmonks responded with the 20-minute video piece.<br/>

			Sunday November 22, 2pm<br/>
<br/>
			In a small town in Abruzzo, Italy 17 artists from the United States, Canada, Europe, UK and Australia gathered for two months to live as Artmonks living together, practicing meditation, training as artists, and making this new dance-theater performance.<br/>
<br/>
			Si Quis Sitit, the Art Monastery’s newest performance, has an ensemble of six high-energy actor-dancers, plus two outstanding musicians creating live music for the show. It is the story of one woman\'s struggle to heal from sickness, as her small village struggles with the balance of adapting to the modern world while honouring it\'s traditions and cultural heritage. How will she heal? How do dynamics of power and oppression affect her ability to come into her full health and power? In this dynamic piece, we explore themes of wellness, oppression, ancient and modern healing medicine, and family.</p>
