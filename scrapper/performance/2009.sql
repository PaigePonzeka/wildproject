<p>A new American comedy about a big Korean birthday</p>

 

<p>Min Suk Chun returns to the ex-wife and family he left 15 years ago in a West Texas suburb, to celebrate his hwangap  the Korean expression for the much-revered 60th birthday that marks rebirth. But whats in store for his next life cycle, if it starts with no pants and a bottle of Jim Beam?

A play by Ashlin Halfnight, 
directed by Kristjan Thor.</p>
<p>In a crumbling, burnt-out America, an underwater bunker stores the relics of our everyday lives: Barbie, Moby Dick, Twinkies and bond traders are all preserved in a labyrinthine warehouse, shelved in boxes, awaiting the stabilization of the continent above. One woman is charged with safeguarding our cultural artifacts for the rebuilding of a great society... but the walls are leaking, resources are running out, and her wide-eyed assistant is hell-bent on losing her virginity to the first man she can find.</p>
<p>As the facility nears collapse, it\'s clear that vast quantities of our legacy will be lost...</p>
<p>What would you save?</p>
<p>Two of the most groundbreaking and original companies in New York City team up to take on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur with Artifacts of Consequence. This collaborative piece, which has been in development for 8 months, takes a theatrical, hilarious, and twisted look at a dystopian American landscape. </p>
<p>Artifacts of Consequence is made possible in part with public funds from the Manhattan Community Arts Fund, supported by New York City Department of Cultural Affairs and administered by Lower Manhattan Cultural Council.  Support also given by the New York Conservatory for Dramatic Arts.</p>

<span class=\"showTitle\">The Secret Agenda of Trees</span>
<p style=\"margin-top:30px;\">A new play by Colin McKenna<br/>
To debut Off-Broadway<br/>
Previews begin March 15,<br/> opens March 19<br/>
<em>March 15 - April 11, 2009</em><br/>
At The Wild Project</p> 
<p>THE SECRET AGENDA OF TREES <br/> a new play by Colin McKenna  will debut Off-Broadway with previews beginning Sunday, March 15 prior to its official press opening on Thursday, March 19 at The Wild Project (195 East 3rd Street) in Manhattan.</p>
<p>The play is directed by Michael Kimmel with a cast featuring Lillian Wright (\"Parking Lot Lonely Heart\"), Reyna de Courcy (\"Esoterica\"), Michael Tisdale (\"The Private Lives of Eskimos\" \"Freulein Else\"), Brian Reilly, and Christian Navarro.</p>
<p>THE SECRET AGENDA OF TREES is set in a rural community in the backwoods of America where escape and fantasy substitute for hope:  a tattered bond holds together Veronica, a 13-year-old who survives on a dream-life filled with Rosemary Clooney and Veronica Lake, and her mother, who dulls the pain of work at a slaughterhouse with booze and meth. As Veronica develops a dubious crush on a tattooed boy from study hall, and her mother invites a mysterious stranger into their ramshackle home, the cycles of dependency become increasingly dangerous and holding the world at bay may prove impossible.</p>
<p>THE SECRET AGENDA OF TREES has scenic and lighting design by Ben Kato, and costume design by Jessica Gaffney. Elizabeth Nielsen is production manager.</p>
<p>THE SECRET AGENDA OF TREES was a finalist chosen by playwright Edward Albee when he served as judge for the first-ever Yale Drama Series in 2007. Prior to its Off-Broadway debut, the play was presented as part of the Cherry Lane Theatre\'s Mentor Project (mentor, Lynn Nottage), and has received The Goldberg Prize, NTC\'s Stavis Award and the John Golden Playwriting Award. Mr. McKenna\'s play \"any-body\" was presented at the Actor\'s Theatre of Louisville, and his play \"Parking Lot Lonely Heart\" was produced by Boomerang Theatre in NYC last fall, while other plays have been performed at Soho Rep and La MaMa ETC.</p>

<p>Director Michael Kimmel has helmed \"Actors Are F%#$ing Stupid\" by Ian Mcwethy, Len Jenkin\'s \"Kraken,\" and Timothy Mansfield\'s \"January 1986,\" as well as Peter Weiss\' \"Marat/Sade\" at Access Theater and the 60th-anniversary production of Ferdinand Bruckner\'s \"The Criminals.\"</p>
<p>THE SECRET AGENDA OF TREES is presented Off-Broadway by Push Productions with Executive Producer J. Edward Cecala in association with The Wild Project. Push Productions was founded in 1999 by Tom Escovar to revitalize the downtown theater scene with innovative work and give new and daring theater artists the necessary outlet to have their voices heard.  Push has produced notable productions including; the 60th Anniversary production of \"The Criminals\" by Ferdinand Bruckner, the 2006 revival of \"Marat/Sade\" at the Access Theater and the New York premiere production of Len Jenkins\' \"Kraken.\"</p>
<p>The Wild Project is a new eco-conscious theater space on the Lower East Side. The theater\'s previous productions include \"33 to Nothing,\" \"This is Way Beyond My Control,\" and \"Sexual Neuroses of Our Parents.\"</p>
<p>Performances of THE SECRET AGENDA OF TREES run March 15 through April 11 at The Wild Project (195 East 3rd Street); Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., with an added performance on Sunday, March 15 at 7 p.m. <!-- Tickets are $18.

<p style=\"margin-top:-15px;\"><em>September 29, October 3, 4</em></p>
<p>In this haunting drama, Catherine Holly has witnessed the shocking and mysterious death of her cousin, and returns home to his family, who dont believe her story.  Catharine seems to be suffering from insanity, and the dead boys mother is so eager to deny the facts about his death that she ruthlessly has Catharine put away in a mental institution, ready to order up a lobotomy, as soon as she puts down her daiquiri.</p>
<p>Directed by Karen Lordi-Kirkham.<br/>
	Featuring Brian A. Costello, Eileen Glenn, Kelli Holsopple, Marlene May, Kathleen A. Menino, Matt Stapleton, and Elise Stone.</p>
<h2>A Lovely Sunday for Creve Coeur</h2>
<p style=\"margin-top:-15px;\"><em>November 17, 21, 22</em></p>
<p>Hopelessly romantic Dorothea is a high school teacher who imagines shell marry her principal.  She rooms with a spinster who constantly tries to fix her up with her brother, but Dorothea plans to leave and move in with a snobby art teacher who has classier digs  and there she can prepare for her delusional nuptials.  Dreamy Dorothea is forced to face reality as shes caught between worlds in this funny and compassionate play.</p>
<h2>In the Bar of a Tokyo Hotel</h2>
<p style=\"margin-top:-15px;\"><em>December 15, 19, 20</em></p>
<p>In this honest and affecting play, an alcoholic painter is on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  Holed up his Tokyo hotel room, he tries to develop a new style and revive his career.  Downstairs in the lounge, his promiscuous wife crudely tries to seduce the Japanese bartender.  Desperate to be free of her husband, but not his money, she begs an art dealer to take the artist back to New York.</p>
