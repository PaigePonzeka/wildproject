<p>28bars Productions and Other Side Productions in association with The Wild Project present 
</p>
<p class=\"showTitle\">Accidentally, Like A Martyr</p>
<p>a new play by Grant James Varjas</p>

<p>New York, NY (May 4, 2010)  28bars Productions and Other Side Productions are proud to present a special limited run, in honor and celebration of Gay Pride Week in New York, of Accidentally, Like A Martyr. The new play, written and directed by Grant James Varjas, will run for five performances only, <em>June 23-26 at the Wild Project</em>, 195 East 3rd Street (between Avenues A and B).
</p>
<p>Accidentally, Like A Martyr takes place in a gay bar on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where a group of men from different backgrounds and generations talk, joke and drink their way through a slow and lonely winter evening. Old secrets are revealed and old wounds re-opened in a serio-comic play inspired and influenced by Mart Crowleys The Boys in the Band and Tennessee Williamss Small Craft Warnings. Accidentally, Like A Martyr is a funny and poignant look at gay men growing older in the new century.
</p>
<p>The cast will include <em>Keith McDermott</em>, <em>Grant James Varjas</em>, <em>Chuck Blasius</em>, <em>Ken Forman</em>, <em>Joe MacDougall</em> and <em>Philip Taratula</em> (The Lilys Revenge).</p>
<p><em>Grant James Varjas</em> is the writer and composer of the GLAAD (Gay And Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) nominated play with music 33 To Nothing, which was directed by Randal Myler (Love, Janis) in a much-acclaimed Off-Broadway production in New York City.  He is a member of the Tectonic Theatre Company where he has collaborated with Moises Kaufman on various projects as a writer and actor, ranging from the film version of The Laramie Project to the recent play 33 Variations. He has acted in numerous Off and Off Off Broadway productions, on television (including Sex And The City and Law and Order: Criminal Intent) and in the upcoming film Peter And Vandy (Strand Releasing). Grant attended the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in NYC, and has studied with Tom Noonan.</p>

<p>Extant Arts Company presents</p>
<p class=\"showTitle\">Blue Surge</p>
<p>Written by Rebecca Gilman<br/>
Directed by Kat Vecchio</p>

<p>Join Extant Arts as they open their 2010 season with the romantic tragedy <i>Blue Surge</i> by the acclaimed contemporary playwright, Rebecca Gilman. <i>Blue Surge</i> confronts the American taboo of class through the experiences of a a small-town cop who struggles to \"save\" a young hooker.</p>
<p>Extant Arts is excited to work with director and documentarian Kat Vecchio on <i>Blue Surge</i>. \"Kat brings a keen and sensitive eye to Gilman\'s richly-drawn characters,\" says Artistic Director Greg Taubman. \"She has real knack for finding the vibrancy and subtle drama of unexpected moments.\" Vecchio has worked at Nerve Ensemble for Phenomenon, New York Musical Theater Festival, and the Public\'s Summer Play Festival. She has recently directed for The Looking Glass Theatre\'s Writer / Director Forum and The Theatre Rats Annual Chester Horn Short Play Festival where audiences voted her Best Director.</p>
<p>\"<i>Blue Surge</i> touches on something both universal and at the same time quintessentially American,\" says Vecchio, an Oklahoma native. \"It explores how people react to the opportunities (or lack thereof) that are presented to them and how money (or the fear of having none) drives their decisions. We\'re told to believe that there are two Americas, but Gilman\'s heartbreaking portrayal of the challenges faced by folks in small-town Wisconsin is a powerful statement the \'lives of quiet desperation\' lived by many Americans, both in the heartland and on the coasts.\"</p>

<p>A brutally funny modern tragedy, Electra in a One-Piece re-imagines the bloody Greek tale for our digital era. When Elle discovers that her mother has murdered her father and is burying him in the backyard, she sends for help the only way she knows how: the internet. Armed only with a video camera, she videotapes the gruesome scene and posts it on YouTube to alert her brother stationed in Iraq, inadvertently becoming an overnight YouTube sensation. Urged on by the chatter of anonymous commenters clamoring for more, Elle and her family saturate the internet with videos, stirring controversy and piquing the interest of a savvy television producer with plans for a camera-ready bloodbath. </p>

<p class=\"showTitle\">No Place Called Home <br/>
...this isn\'t supposed to be a love story.</p>
<p>Written and Performed by Kim Schultz</p>
<p>Directed by Sarah Cameron Sunde</p>
<p>Music by Amikaeyla Gaston</p>
<h2 class=\"firstheader\">synopsis:</h2>
<p>Omar? O my...</p>
<p>The playwright Kim Schultz traveled to the middle east to interview Iraqi refugees and hear their stories. Falling in love with one of them was never part of her plan, but Omar changed all that.</p>
<p><em>No Place Called Home</em> is that unexpected true story of an American woman and an Iraqi man, a story about one refugee out of 4 million, a story that isn\'t supposed to be a love story. </p>
<p>In the fall of 2009, Intersections International brought a delegation of American artists to Jordan, Lebanon and Syria to interview Iraqi refugees.</p>
<p>Their mission was to witness firsthand the heartbreaking and often tragic personal stories of Iraqi refugees living in exile.</p>
<p>The hope is to harness the power of the arts to focus attention on the Iraqi refugee crisis. Upon returning to the US, they created art inspired by the experience of which <em>No Place Called Home</em> is the centerpiece. </p>
<p>\"As a refugee myself, I gave up to the fact that no one can hold the complexity of this crisis, it\'s so complicated and different. Yet I as wrong. I was captured from the first word until the end!\"--Ibrahim, resettled Iraqi refugee after seeing the play.</p>

<h2 class=\"firstheader\">synopsis:</h2>
<p>Quiet Frenzy is a solo show about grief and awakening.  After a family tragedy, LaShonda falls apart and comes together in a fractured symphony of remembrance and rebirth, loss and laughter.</p>
<h2>review:</h2>
<p>Stacey Robinson is an otherwordly talent. The experience of her performance work and her writing has indelibly changed me as a human being. You\'ve heard the expression \'the emperor has no clothes...\' Well - this empress is DECKED OUT in garments made of earth wind fire and water and her jewels are the stars in the night sky.  STACEY IS FOR REAL and IS BRINGING IT. This is a rare opportunity to see what in my opinion is greatness embodied. GET HERE!!!<br/>

<p>In October 2009, a composer/ lyricist team was asked to select a fortune cookie. They created a piece based on the fortune. Two weeks later, they presented their work to the next artist in the series. This artist then had two weeks to create a piece based on the work shown to him (never having seen the fortune), and then presented his art to the next artist. She then created a pieceand then another artist, and then another artist eventually, ten in all.
From April 21st  May 1st 2010, the assembled works of all ten artists will be presented live, in-sequence, at the
Wild Project in New York Citys East Village.</p>
<p>Witness the next stage in the convergence of media. Now in its fourth season, Synesthesia is a live, annual event which unites a select and diverse range of arts and artists for eight days only. Synesthesia is an Electric Pear exclusive production, conceived by Ashlin Halfnight and Melanie Sylvan, and staged for the first time in 2007. This years show will offer up an evening of original music, theatre, art, film, danceand surprises!
