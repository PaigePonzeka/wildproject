<p>The wild project, a new contemporary arts space, is pleased to present its inaugural exhibition, <em>hint</em>, an 
	  	  installation of photographs and videos by Jodie Vicenta Jacobson.  Making pictures involving diverse 
	  	  subject matter, the artist’s thoughtful treatment of tender fruits, illuminated shadows and entangled limbs 
	  	  reveals a sensual, poetic sensibility.  In Peaches, nestled between pillows, two luminous fruits touch, 
	  	  encircled by a curved spectrum of refracted light.  The image communicates how a chance phenomenon 
	  	  can be transformed to evoke beauty’s dark side.  In her video work, The Vale, the artist frames mist as it 
	  	  slowly traverses a New Zealand valley, intensifying and diminishing to the soundtrack of the environment. 
	  	  Jacobson’s instinctual images give the impression of a deeply felt personal experience infused with a quiet 
    appreciation of the darkness, hidden sensuality, and grandeur of the natural world.</p>
<h2>The Artist </h2>

        curator.  She exhibits widely in New York, Europe, and Japan.  In 2004, she received her MFA from Hunter

<p><i>Big Smile,</i> 2008, collaged paper, ink, acrylic, colored pencil and graphite on paper, 28 x 22 inches</p>
<p><i>Funny Feeling,</i> 2008, collaged paper, ink, acrylic and graphite on paper, 13 x 10 inches</p>

<p>The Wild Project is pleased to present its second exhibition, Vanitas, an installation of works on paper by
Joseph Hart. Fusing painting, drawing, and collage techniques, Hart focuses on the language of display. His
detailed renderings of museum vitrines and his delicate reinterpretations of classical floral still lifes examine
how beauty is idealized and value is assigned to objects. In Drawing Against Itself No.2, images of busts,
heads and other artifacts sit atop sharp lines as if they were the proudly speared conquests of a primitive
ritual. In Funny Feeling, shards of color extend across an obsessively drawn backdrop of graphite mimicking
a botanical still life on the brink of extinction. Hart!s elegant images highlight the significance of viewing
history through artifact.</p>
<p>Originally from New Hampshire, Hart lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. He received a BFA from the
Rhode Island School of Design in 1999. Most recently, his work was featured in the New Talents section at
Art Cologne, and in Here And Elsewhere, an exhibition of emerging artists at The Bronx Museum of the Arts.
He also recently served as a jury member for the 2008 Scholastic Art Awards, a national scholarship
program for young artists. Hart\'s mixed media works on paper have been exhibited at Galerie Markus Winter
in Berlin, Galleri Loyal in Stockholm, Galeri Vidal St. Phalle in Paris, Klaus Von Nichtssagend in Brooklyn, as
well as Alexander &amp; Bonin, Freight + Volume and CRG Gallery in New York.</p>
<p>The Wild Project, a new environmentally conscious venue for contemporary theater, film, and visual arts, is
dedicated to supporting the arts by offering space and resources to emerging artists. Our programming
intends to cultivate a supportive artistic network, explore innovative and thoughtful approaches to art making
and by doing so enrich the local community.</p>
