<p>The Wild Project is pleased to present a series of photographs by Marisol Villanueva, entitled <i>UNCAGED: The Unnatural History of Cage Birds</i>.  The artist discusses this body of work as follows: 
</p>
<p>Since the mid 1990s, my work has been dedicated to photographing indigenous people, their threatened ways of living and their endangered habitats  on self-assigned projects and in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution. The opportunity of traveling to remote pristine places where nature has been untouched for millennia has awakened my relationship to the phenomenon of the beauty of spirit in nature.
</p>
<p>For the past ten years I have lived and worked in New York City, where opportunities of experiencing nature in its full splendor are somewhat rare, but can be found. In 1997 I began bird watching in Central Park. As an artist, the observation of wild birds has opened my eyes to see what we tend to overlook, and to hear that to which we are often deafened. </p>
<p>Through my experiences, both as an avid birder and through photographing caged birds in an intimate interior setting, I am privileged to witness and capture their free spirit in the world we live in. It is a time of turmoil for our natural environment, but also a time of unimaginable opportunity to care for our world in new creative ways.
</p>
<p>With <i>UNCAGED: The Unnatural History of Cage Birds</i> I hope to create a connection between the original wildness of birds and the sense of freedom they evoke within those who view them.

<p>The Wild Project is pleased to present <i>Scapes</i> an installation of photographs by Elisabeth Bernstein. Bernsteins seemingly familiar landscapes, at first glance, look as though they could be taken from places throughout the world. However, after close examination the viewer will notice that they have been fabricated for the camera. Using paint pigments and strategic camera placement to confound our expectations of weight and scale her images resemble mountainous terrains from an indeterminate time. These images move beyond being a series of unusual observations towards a conceptual territory where the subject is not quickly deciphered but gradually made more tangible through its range of possible states.</p>
<p>Elisabeth Bernstein (b. 1980) was raised between New York and Washington, D.C. and is currently based in New York. Bernstein graduated from Brown University in 2003 with a BA in Visual Arts and Political Science. Her work has been exhibited in group shows nationally. This is her first solo exhibition.</p>
<p>The Wild Project, an environmentally conscious venue for contemporary theater, film, and visual arts, is dedicated to supporting the arts by offering space and resources to emerging artists.  The first gallery and theatre space in New York City to have a green roof, Wild Projects programming intends to cultivate a supportive artistic network, explore innovative and thoughtful approaches to art making and by doing so enrich the local community. </p>

<p><em>The Wild Project</em> is pleased to present <em>Back to the Future</em>, a solo exhibition of photographs by Rob Roth October 13th – 30th  2010.</p>
<p>The works in this exhibition were created specifically for the spectacular New York club event Click + Drag, which ran for four years beginning in 1996. Founded by Roth with nightlife legends Chi Chi Valenti and Kitty Boots, Click + Drag began as a Saturday-night weekly event at Valenti’s experimental MOTHER nightclub and ran for four years in over two hundred editions, each with a different theme. Exploring the interface between nightclubs and computer culture with a strictly enforced dress code, the event quickly built a fanatic following. The textures of those nights were otherworldly, created and enhanced by Roth’s pioneering video installations and performances that both encouraged and complimented the antics of his guests.</p>
<p>Created between 1999 and 2001, most of the photographs selected for the exhibition were shot for Click + Drag’s much coveted and collected flyers. The flyers depicted an eclectic mix of rock stars, dominatrixes, transsexuals, strippers and fetishists. Necessity was the mother of invention for Roth, who shot the portraits in his small Manhattan studio apartment with Kitty Boots as stylist and Marla Belt on makeup.</p>
<p>Despite Roth’s well-regarded reputation as a pioneering digital artist, the majority of the images were deliberately shot using 35 mm film and printed on the now discontinued Fujiflex paper, with absolutely no retouching. Always going against the trend Roth made this decision as the world went digital. The results were small color prints that possess a striking, oversaturated, jewel-like quality and present the subjects as iconic, patron saints of desire, transformation and sexuality.</p>
<p>Three of the images in this exhibition are more recent digital portraits made for Roth’s new large-scale annual incarnations of Click + Drag between 2008 and 2010. But regardless of year or venue, the images all share a common love of beauty, transformation and above all, the night.</p>
<p>The New York City-born director and visual artist has been a persistent and influential presence in the city’s downtown art and culture since the early 1990’s. His work draws from photography, video, painting, dramaturgy and theater to create experiences that transcend the limits of media and performance. His work has been presented at a variety of venues including the New Museum for Contemporary Art, Performance Space122, Abrons Art Center, Galapagos Art Space, and Deitch Projects as well as the Whitney Museum of American Art.  Recently Roth was part of the London Biennale NYC Satellite Event at the Christopher Henry Gallery and will also be premiering the video version of his award winning performance piece Screen Test at the Museum of Art and Design in late October.</p>
<p>FROM THE ARTISTS, ABOUT ROB ROTH:</p>
<p>I always said that visual artist Rob Roth was a nouveau Cocteau.<br/>
- Michael Musto (Village Voice)</p>
<p>Rob is a true artist/ auteur/ shaman of the new century. He has exquisite taste, astounding technical skills, and above all a vision that is all encompassing...but most of all... he pulls it off.<br/>
- Basil Twist (Master Puppeteer)</p>
<p>Sex fiend, drunkard, visionary<br/>
- Debbie Harry</p>
<p>Populated by androgens and beauties in various states of perverse/glamorous dress, Roth\'s images portray characters living in a haunted, future-is-now world all of their own, oblivious to the machinations of daylight culture.<br/>

<p><em>The Wild Project</em> is pleased to present <i>As A Real House</i>, the first solo exhibition of photographs by <a href=\"http://sarahpalmerphotography.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Sarah Palmer</a>. The exhibition culls images from Palmers series of the same title, which evolved from previous work that sought memory, lost time, and hints of the absent-present in landscapes, rooms, and objects. <i>As A Real House</i> turns these ideas inward, departing from a critical exploration of the sentimental and the sweet, and moves into darker corners of remembrance, identity, and invention. The work explores the artists futile attempt to study time by stopping it mid-decay, and traces of her search for the possible and impossible within the medium. Palmer plays with elements of scale to reveal the vulnerability of both the subject and medium. <i>As A Real House</i> delves into the self-reflexive realms of photography, commenting directly on the boundary between what is real and what is invented, immediate and hidden, desirable and grotesque. </p>
<p>Sarah Palmer was born in 1977 in San Francisco, CA, and currently lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. She received her MFA in Photography, Video and Related Media from School of Visual Arts in 2008 and her BA in English/Italian from Vassar College in 1999. She was awarded an Aaron Siskind Foundation Fellowship in 2007. Her work is currently featured in the exhibition <i>31 Women in Art Photography</i> at Affirmation Arts, New York. She has been visiting critic at School of Visual Arts and Adelphi University among other institutions. She has done portfolio reviews and sat on grant panels for Lower Manhattan Cultural Council, the Art Directors Club, School of Visual Arts, and Rooftop Films.</p>

<p><em>The Wild Project</em> and mr. and mrs. amani olu are pleased to present <em>After the Women of Paradise Road</em>, an exhibition of photographs and installation by <em>Nathaniel Ward</em>. This is the artist’s first solo exhibition in New York.</p>
<p>In <em>After the Women of Paradise Road</em>, Ward investigates how hetero-normative sexuality functions in society by appropriating the covers of adult periodicals distributed in magazine vending boxes that line Paradise Road in Las Vegas. The exhibition includes four large-scale color photographs that reflect the spectrum of idealized eroticism from suggestive to hardcore. Through a set of hackneyed sexual poses, expressions and gestures, and the sectioning of the human body, the women who pose for these photographs are elevated to anonymous, marketable objects of desire. However, like any commodity, the introduction of new and improved “products” to the “marketplace” thwarts their short-lived tenure as covetous. Thus, the system that once celebrated their conventional beauty, eventually abandons it, leaving these women to rot on places like Paradise Road. Ward photographs these women in this depressed state, complete with weathering, sun bleaching, and surface detritus. These magnified obstructions (bird feces, half torn stickers, etc.) further separate the model that originally posed for the photograph from the viewer, leaving him or her with an abstracted image. These abstractions become objects or inconsequential material that abets the desensitization of emotional intimacy.</p>
<p>In an effort to materialize these notions, Ward flew to Las Vegas to purchase a magazine vending box, which he installed in the gallery along with adult sex cards littered about the gallery’s floor as refuse. This site-responsive installation confronts the viewer, encouraging a meaningful interaction with the exhibition. By covering the floor with sex cards, the viewer must step on a very particular representation of women, thereby making him or her complicit in the discarding process, just as they would be on the streets of Las Vegas. This aspect of the installation suggests that complicity is a default position. In other words, to approve or disapprove of gendered socialization and aesthetics is to fuel the engine that keeps it running. This appropriation of space and material activates the gallery and provides a tactile element necessary to bring the viewer one step closer to the spectacle of mass-marketed female sexuality.</p>
<p>Nathaniel Ward (b. 1983) lives and works in Brooklyn, NY. In 2006, Ward received his BFA from NYU’s Tisch School of the Arts in the Department of Photography &amp; Imaging after briefly studying painting and drawing at the Rhode Island School of Design. Ward has exhibited internationally since 2005, including exhibitions at the Center for Architecture, Gulf + Western Gallery, Broadway Gallery in New York, and as a part of independently curated group exhibitions at LOOKBetween 2010, SCOPE Art Show, Miami, and Art at Kirchberg, Luxembourg.</p>
