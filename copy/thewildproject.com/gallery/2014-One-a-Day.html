			<p>In December of 2012, I stumbled upon a post online about a photographer who was finishing what&rsquo;s known in the photography world as a &ldquo;365 project.&rdquo; In a &ldquo;365,&rdquo; a photographer will post one photo per day for a full year. The subject matter? Anything. The purpose? To commit to creating something daily. In seeing this photographer&rsquo;s work (made mostly of surrealistic self-portraits), something came alive inside of me. A spark &ndash; an inner &ldquo;creation-permission slip.&rdquo; I was instantly enamored with this idea of a committed daily practice with a tangible outcome. And since I&rsquo;m the only one on my bizarre, ever-shifting schedule, a self-portrait project felt feasible.</p>

			<p>I wanted to begin immediately. I already had a slew of images to choose from to get the ball rolling because I&rsquo;d been doing a lot of test-shooting with myself as the subject in an effort to hone my skills. The notion of a full year&rsquo;s worth didn&rsquo;t seem conceivable to me, so instead I more loosely set the intention to post one photo per day&hellip; for as long as it felt right (hence, &ldquo;One-a-Day&rdquo;). I never imagined it would last as long as it did, nor did I anticipate what I might begin to discover throughout the process (and beyond). I posted photos for 115 days solid. After this I took a break, and resumed with more as inspirations arose.</p>

			<p>All my life I&rsquo;ve felt sparks of creation, but I was better at seeing them through when I was a child. As the years went by I stopped listening to these creative stirrings, and I fell out of the practice. One of the most important things this project did for me was give me an excuse to create and a daily deadline &ndash; no matter what. As I&rsquo;ve tried to make sense of my world over the years, I&rsquo;ve been getting progressively better at breathing life into ideas as they come to me. Life just feels better this way. Can an inspiration be a fluke? I believe they arise because we&rsquo;re meant to birth them (and that it can be quite painful if we don&rsquo;t). Pretending they were never there doesn&rsquo;t help.</p>

			<p>You&rsquo;ve heard it before, and you&rsquo;ll hear it again - when you&rsquo;re passionate about what you&rsquo;re doing, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like work. It takes time still, and there might not be an obvious formula for success, but when you&rsquo;re engaged in what you love, it truly doesn&rsquo;t feel like work. My hope is that sharing this project will inspire people to make something - to engage in a practice - to ponder, &ldquo;What do I love so much that when I do it I become lost in it?&rdquo; &ndash; to begin some sort of daily creative practice (even amidst any voices of doubt, judgment, or criticism). At the end of the day, &ldquo;failure&rdquo; is a myth. When you strip it of the shame/embarrassment/fear it wears, it&rsquo;s truly just feedback. Sometimes (dare I say) it&rsquo;s a miracle &ndash; a secret passageway into unmapped territories that you might not discover any other way. So if you knew you couldn&rsquo;t fail, don&rsquo;t you ever wonder, &ldquo;What wants to be expressed through me? What am I here to create?&rdquo;</p>
