	<h3>NEW YORK CITY OPENS FIRST ECO-FRIENDLY THEATRE</h3>




<p>New York City and the Off Off-Broadway community will christen the city's first "green" theatre when The Wild Project revives its production of 33 to Nothing. </p>

<p>After a sold-out engagement in 2006, Grant James Varjas' play with music, 33 to Nothing, will begin an open-ended run with previews beginning July 19 and an official opening set for July 25. </p>

<p>According to press notes, "This downtown NYC garage band is on the edge of breaking-up as the lead singer and his boyfriend (also in the band) are, er, breaking-up. With each year that passes that they aren't rock stars the incessant pull of adulthood becomes harder to ignore. With more axes to grind than grinding the ax is it even worth staying together?" </p>

<p>33 to Nothing features a cast of five, all of whom play their own instruments. They are John Good, Amanda Gruss (both in Tom Noonan's Waiting; Territory at Bottle Factory), Grant Varjas (Laramie Project, Territory at the Bottle Factory), Ken Forman (Late Fragment at Studio Dante; Wilder, Wilder, Wilder on Broadway) and Preston Clarke (singer/songwriter – recent network television debut on "The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson"). Keith Levenson is musical director. </p>

<p>33 to Nothing director Randal Myler received two Tony Award nominations and a Drama Desk nomination for It Ain't Nothin' But The Blues. His other credits include Love, Janis, Mr. Myler's musical biography of Janis Joplin; Dream A Little Dream: The Mamas And The Papas Musical; and Hank Williams: Lost Highway. </p>

<p>Formerly The Bottle Factory Theatre, the newly renovated 99-seat home of The Wild Project includes eco-friendly features like recycled glass tiles, bamboo plywood, low flush toilets, rooftop solar panels and energy-efficient glass windows. Even the theatre's concessions will be environmentally conscious with eco-friendly paper products and a selection of organic beer and wine. </p>
