			<p><em>DELICIOUS PERSPECTIVE</em><br />
			direction by Antonio Padovani, written by Antonio Padovani &amp; Cristiana Regini<br />
			11 mins (Italy)<br />
			Anna is coming: finally, a night together, a night awaited for so long, but the anticipation now makes her uneasy and scares her. Something is troubling her. The fear of breaking a taboo? Feelings of inadequacy? Her conscience? An undefined sense of guilt? All things that can kill. Literally.</p>

			<p><em>TGF: MARATHON GAY SEX FOR MANLY MEN</em><br />
			direction by Johnny Chiba<br />
			3 mins (NYC﻿)<br />
			Kneepad Nikki, Doc Octocock and Joe Test&iacute;culo created TFG&rsquo;s self titled album during the summer of 2015. Dicks were sucked, bagels were eaten and hits were created. The lead single, &lsquo;Marathon Gay Sex For Manly Men&rsquo; was recorded first; followed by 9 other homoerotic hymns. Joe explains, &lsquo;I saw potential audiences for TFG that Nikki was unable to see; queercore, grindcore, electronic music, even Howard Stern fans. I also pointed out the similarities between TFG and the movie Bruno, which made millions of dollars for its studio and star. We&rsquo;re not aiming that high; but the money coming in from downloads and streaming should cover our lube and condom bills for the year.&rsquo;</p>
