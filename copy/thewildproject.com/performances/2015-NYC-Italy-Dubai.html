			&ldquo;Prime&rdquo; is a co-production of the Art Monastery Project (based in San Francisco and Italy) and Loom Ensemble (based in NYC and Dubai).<br />
			<br />
			A two person performance created by an ensemble of 10 artists, born out of the intersection of contemplative practice, communal living, and collaborative theater-making.<br />
			<br />
			It&rsquo;s a story about relationships and communication, wound around the theme of dawn time, full of dream imagery and symbolism inspired by the elements.<br />

			<p><em>Acaya</em><br />
			Wednesday November 18, 7pm<br />
			Friday November 20, 8pm<br />
			<br />
			Video screening in combination with Prime<br />
			<br />
			As part of the spring 2013 Art Monastic Laboratory, three Artmonks hosted a series of interviews with the people of Acaya, an extremely small town in southern Italy. The interviews revolved around questions of personal and cultural transformation, stories from the past, and hopes for the future. From the overarching themes, day-to-day feelings, and actual footage gleaned from those interviews and the region of Puglia, the Artmonks responded with the 20-minute video piece.<br />

			Sunday November 22, 9pm<br />

			Loom Ensemble&rsquo;s newest show, developed first via 6 months of Skype rehearsals, then at &ldquo;thejamjar&rdquo; an arts warehouse in Dubai, and finally on a farm in the Hudson Valley. Say I Am You asks &ldquo;what makes us whole,&rdquo; through song settings of Rumi poetry, choreography to reframe the immune system, a modern retelling of a Zen koan, and the sarcastic whining of one punk kid.<br />

			<p><em>Si Quis Sitit</em><br />
			Tuesday November 17, 7pm<br />
			Friday November 20, 8pm<br />
			Sunday November 22, 2pm<br />
			<br />
			In a small town in Abruzzo, Italy 17 artists from the United States, Canada, Europe, UK and Australia gathered for two months to live as Artmonks living together, practicing meditation, training as artists, and making this new dance-theater performance.<br />
			<br />
			Si Quis Sitit, the Art Monastery&rsquo;s newest performance, has an ensemble of six high-energy actor-dancers, plus two outstanding musicians creating live music for the show. It is the story of one woman&#39;s struggle to heal from sickness, as her small village struggles with the balance of adapting to the modern world while honouring it&#39;s traditions and cultural heritage. How will she heal? How do dynamics of power and oppression affect her ability to come into her full health and power? In this dynamic piece, we explore themes of wellness, oppression, ancient and modern healing medicine, and family.</p>

			<p><em>re:self-&gt;</em><br />
			Saturday November 21, 9pm<br />
			<br />
			Performed in combination with Prime<br />
			<br />
			Using multiple camera, multi projector video feedback and puppetry, &ldquo;re:self&rdquo; re:questions the self through refracted, rerouted, mandala like imagery.<br />
			<br />
			This is a show regarding self-&gt;reconstruction and organised divergence.<br />
			If &ldquo;-&gt;&rdquo; is seen as insertion, (or as input, or as function)<br />
			then&hellip;<br />
			I&rsquo;m bouncing between the self-&gt;re.fractured to self-&gt;production through self chatter, looping video image and routing the flow.<br />
			Re:com.position of oneself by conning one:self. It&rsquo;s self-&gt;manipulation baby!<br />
			Or. Self-&gt;puppetry. With real, actual, puppets. To project oneself on a voodoo doll of one:self.<br />
			Can I be manipulated when I know I&rsquo;m being manipulated by my:self?<br />
			A complex re.combination, onto, into, through each other:  a mash up<br />
			a self-&gt;made mash up<br />
			a mash up of the self<br />
			&ldquo;re:self&rdquo; is a show in regards to self-&gt;re:composition and self-&gt;re:representation.<br />
			<br />
			What is real? What is re:reproduced.</p>
