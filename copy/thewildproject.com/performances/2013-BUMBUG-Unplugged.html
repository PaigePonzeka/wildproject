			<p>Music by Samrat Chakrabarti<br />
			Book &amp; Lyrics by Samrat Chakrabarti &amp; Sanjiv Jhaveri<br />
			Produced by LAUGHistan, LLC</p>



			<p>BUMBUG Unplugged, an encore presentation, of a new Rock Opera by Samrat Chakrabarti and Sanjiv Jhaveri, is an electrifying musical reinvention of &ldquo;A Christmas Carol&rdquo; told through the looking glass of NYC Immigrants and Hyphenated America. Like so many immigrants, disillusioned Deli-owner Scroogewala left his motherland years ago to pursue the American dream. Amidst his battle with holiday merriment, Scroogewala is visited by a motley crew of misfits who remind him that love, loss and laughter are all a part of that dream he&rsquo;d almost given up on.</p>
