			<p><img align="Right" alt="" hspace="10" src="img/2018-SipFest.jpg" vspace="10" />SipFest, a new festival showcasing some of the coolest women theatremakers, has announced a lineup of multimedia works at different levels of development.</p>

			<p>&quot;When Spaceman was tragically postponed, we had this marvelous theatre that was going to sit empty for a few weeks. Taking a few hours to mourn, I immediately reached out to some of my favorite theatermakers and came up with a fierce lineup of groundbreaking women who will show deeply personal and totally fierce work.&rdquo; said Loading Dock producer Charles Quittner. &ldquo;Audiences will see readings, multimedia, puppetry, and of course a little drag.&quot;</p>

			<p>SipFest features theatrical works by Cherry Lou Sy, Asia Gagnon and Max Bernstein, Sofya Levitsky Weitz and Sarah Blush, Maiko Kikuchi, Kat Yen and Christopher Audley Puglisi and additional artists to be announced.</p>
