			<p>The 2014 Summit is a film festival event showcasing 19 films over three days from independent and emerging filmmakers spearheading a new wave of cinematic storytelling. The film lineup unfurls an array of features and short films that explore uncommon subject matters through a spectrum of diverse genres and characters. Official selections include feature films traversing major festivals, short film premieres and the Best Of from the past year.</p>

			<p><em>OFFICIAL SELECTIONS &ndash; FEATURE FILMS</em></p>

			<p>FAGBUG NATION, Erin Davies director (U. S., documentary) Fagbug Nation takes you behind the wheel of what it&#39;s like to drive the once vandalized, now famous &quot;Fagbug.&quot; With six years of touring under her belt, director Erin Davies (&quot;Fagbug,&quot; 2009, Netflix) has her mind set on getting her car to all 50 states, Hawaii and Alaska being the final two. To pull this off, Erin went 54 days without a car, put her car on 5 boats, and flew on 14 planes. The Fagbug gets leis&#39;d in Hawaii and drives through the midnight sun to Alaska, but first makes a pit stop at the Equality House in Topeka, Kansas. Watch as this rainbow colored Beetle serves as a catalyst for our nation on the road to equality.</p>

			<p>GRANTHAM &amp; ROSE, Kristin Hanggi director/Ryan Spahn writer (U. S., narrative/drama) Seventeen-year-old Grantham (Jake T. Austin) struggles to find his way as a man when a spontaneous road trip thrusts him into the care of a feisty eighty-one-year-old African-American woman named Rose (Golden Globe &amp; Emmy Nominee Marla Gibbs) who, while on the road, takes it upon herself to be a stable figure in Grantham&rsquo;s life. Rose gives Grantham the tough love he needs, while Grantham helps Rose heal from her hidden and painful past.</p>

			<p>I BELIEVE IN UNICORNS, Leah Meyerhoff director/writer (U. S., narrative/drama) CLOSING NIGHT FEATURE, Davina is an imaginative and strong-willed teenage girl who often escapes into a beautifully twisted fantasy life. Having grown up quickly as the sole caretaker of her disabled mother, she looks for salvation in a new relationship with an older boy. Davina is swept into a whirlwind of romance and adventure, but the enchantment of her new relationship quickly fades when Sterling&#39;s volatile side begins to emerge. I Believe in Unicorns takes us on a road trip through the stunning and complex landscape of troubled young love.</p>

			<p>SEE YOU NEXT TUESDAY, Drew Tobia director/writer (U. S., narrative/dark comedy) OPENING NIGHT FEATURE, Mona (Eleanore Pienta) is a mentally unbalanced and very pregnant young woman in a hideous orange coat. Without any friends to speak of and alienated from her hoochie mama coworkers at a crummy Brooklyn supermarket, Mona maintains a strangely close relationship with her campy, recovering alcoholic mother May (Dana Eskelson). Mona&#39;s sister Jordan (Molly Plunk) is an unemployable party girl, estranged from May and making life hell for her increasingly fed up girlfriend Sylve (Keisha Zollar). In the final days of her pregnancy, Mona draws her mother, sister, and anybody who happens to get caught in her wake into her hectic life as she drifts further from reality.</p>

			<p>SILENT ONES, Ricky Rijneke director/writer (Netherlands, narrative/drama) Csilla and her little brother Isti are travelling together without a clear destination, looking for a better life. One day Csilla wakes up inside a crashed car, in the middle of nowhere, not knowing where her brother Isti is. He is vanished without a trace. Upset and alone, without saying a word, Csilla leaves aboard a cargo ship heading to Western Europe. She flees her country and her past to a cold and lonely life to keep a promise she made to him. But the world she&#39;s left behind won&#39;t let her go that easily. At sea G&aacute;bor, a self-proclaimed businessman who convinced her to work for him on the ship, turns out to be a brute and a drunk. When G&aacute;bor assaults her and takes her last souvenir of Isti, Csilla loses grip on her life completely. The journey turns into a surreal trip on the fragile edge of life and death.</p>

Through Thomas&rsquo; romantic imagination, we embark on a small journey to find the man who stole her goods.</p>

			<p>A SHORT FILM ON EQUALITY, Matt Willis-Jones director/writer (Norway, comedy) Phil get&#39;s time off work for a dubious illness but Carl has been struggling with problems of his own... &#39;All animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others&#39;</p>
