			<p>Poetic Theater Productions presents</p>

			<p class="showTitle">Outside Paducah: The Wars at Home</p>

			<p>written and performed by J. A. Moad II</p>

			<h2 class="firstheader">showtimes &amp; tickets:</h2>

			<p>September 26-October 15</p>

			<p>In Outside Paducah: The Wars at Home, written and performed by J. A. Moad II, we watch the toll of war reverberate across three generations of Americans: A seven year-old boy struggles to make sense of the screaming in the night after his father returns from Afghanistan. A fifty year-old man works to rebuild his life as he wrestles with the memory of an idealistic son&mdash;a teenager turned Marine who came back from Iraq wounded, disillusioned, and broken. And at a bar in the rust-belt remnant of his hometown, a former soldier&rsquo;s midnight encounter brings the past and the present into an explosive, searing reality.</p>

			<p><em>About J.A. Moad II</em><br />
			He is a former Air Force C-130 pilot with over 3000 flight hours and more than 100 combat sorties. He served as an English Professor at the United States Air Force Academy and continues to serve as an editor and blogger for their international journal, War, Literature &amp; the Arts (WLA). His short stories, poetry and essays have appeared in a variety of journals and anthologies, and is the recipient of the 2014 Consequence Magazine Fiction Award. In addition to writing, he has performed on stage at the Library of Congress and at The Guthrie Theater as part of The Telling Project - Giving Voice to the Veteran Experience. His play, Outside Paducah - the Wars at Home debuted in Minneapolis, at the Bloomington Center for the Arts in 2016. He is the driving force behind the Veterans&rsquo; Voices Initiative in Minnesota to teach the stories of Veterans and their families in schools, colleges and community discussion groups. He currently resides in Northfield, MN where he flies, writes, reads, and spend as much time with his family and friends as possible.</p>
