<p>Written by Takeo Rivera, directed by Alex Mallory<br />
Featuring Samantha Cooper, Dontonio Demarco, Natalia Duong, Edgar Eguia, Kenneth Heaton, Monique Paige and Nabil Vi&ntilde;as<br />
<br />Today, as the American military returns home from Iraq and we as a society are trying to comprehend what kind of footprint we've left behind, Goliath provides a way to look deeper into what we do during times of war, what behavior becomes excusable, and what it means to love when violence is part of the norm.<br />
<br />Earlier this year, Goliath had a critically acclaimed run at the Planet Connection Festivity where it received numerous awards including Outstanding Overall Production. Director Alex Mallory (winner, Outstanding Direction) returns to remount Rivera&rsquo;s heartbreaking and intense spoken-word piece.<br />
<br />&ldquo;Goliath is one of the rare gifts that theatre bestows upon us &mdash; powerful and passionately produced, raising important questions about the world we live in today.&rdquo; &mdash; nytheatre.com<br />
<br />&ldquo;As beautifully rendered by Rivera, Mallory, and an excellent cast, Goliath is fresh, honestly emotional, heartbreaking, and true.&rdquo; &mdash; Show Showdown<br />

<p>A Choreodrama by Zo&euml; Flowers<br />
Directed by Chinasa Ogbuagu<br />
Featuring Peggy Johnson, Sherri Pullum, Chantal Maurice and Vesta Walker<br />
<br />Based on Zo&euml; Flowers' Dirty Laundry, a series of candid interviews with women of color who had experienced domestic and sexual violence, From Ashes to Angel's Dust: A Journey Through Womanhood (FA2AD) is a choreodrama that uses monologues; poetry and vignettes to address these issues and provide a forum for discussion and activism through art.<br />
<br />The Ashes Manifesto:<br />
From Ashes to Angel's Dust: A Journey Through Womanhood is for our ancestors that died so that we might live-that starved so we might prosper. It is for those silenced by violence, oppression, homophobia, shame or the impulse to please. This play is for little girls that grow into women looking for fathers in the arms of strange men. It's for all those who ask &quot;why does she stay.&quot; This show is for women who recognize that protection, unconditional love and unconditional freedom can occupy the same space. For all who understand that loving another and one's self is a revolutionary act- the most revolutionary act. In short, From Ashes to Angel's Dust is for complicated, simple, uncompromising, weak, independent, gold-digging, hardworking, hard loving, bitchy, vulnerable, strong, happy, and angry women and all those that choose to love us. <br />

<p class="showTitle"><img hspace="5" alt="" align="right" src="img/kellysmall_0.jpg" />SAY YOU HEARD MY ECHO</p>
<p>Written by Kelly Zen-Yie Tsai<br />
Directed by Jesse Y. Jou, Performed by Aizzah Fatima, Yalinidream, &amp; Kelly Zen-Yie Tsai, Dramaturgy by Amissa Miller<br />
<br />SAY YOU HEARD MY ECHO is an evening-length spoken word poetry theater project that juxtaposes fictional narratives of three Asian American women in NYC a decade after 9/11. Their struggles with survivorship and faith prompt them to call on three female religious icons (Mary Magdalene, Guan Yin, and Aisha) for solace and answers as they come of age in a world impacted by war. Rendered with humor and humanity, SAY YOU HEARD MY ECHO questions what remains sacred in times of war while unearthing intersections between feminism, Asian Pacific Islander American identity, and religious freedom.<br />
