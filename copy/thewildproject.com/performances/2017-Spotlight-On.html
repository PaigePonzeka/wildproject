			<h2 class="firstheader">showtimes:</h2>

			<p>April 17-30</p>

			<p>It has been a decade since Spotlight On had its last solo festival but like the proverbial phoenix we announce the RISE OF THE PHOENIX Festival. As you know we produced as many as 2 to 4 festivals a year at various location all over the city including several in Times Square! For this new Rise of the Phoenix Festival we called upon participants from our early years in the 1990s through to the present. Indeed, this festival contains participants from our many Spotlight On Festivals as well as from our collaborations with Sage Theatre Company in 1996 [our first festival!], Planet Connections Festivity in 2009 and our Fresh Fruit Festival collaboration in 2012.</p>
