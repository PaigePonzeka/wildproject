			<p class="showTitle">Black Latina Movement Summer Series &#39;16</p>

			<h2 class="firstheader">showtimes &amp; tickets:</h2>

			<p>August 23-28</p>


			<p>Founded by the movement&rsquo;s CEO/Founder Crystal Shaniece Roman and Managing Director Shirley Reyes, this week long festival features producing, directing, and writing (by way of theater productions and performances) along with a film screening poised at raising awareness on human trafficking. This festival is history in the making for the Black Latina Movement as this is the first time that they are producing all 3 of the company&rsquo;s theater productions (Black Latina -The Play, The Colors of Love - Stage Play, and Of Mothers And Men - A New Play) simultaneously. Along with presenting their productions they will also dedicate one night of the festival to raising awareness on human trafficking with the Sex, Slavery &amp; Trafficking event. This featured screening of The Trade (a film by Michael Pinckney) will be followed by a Q &amp; A with an esteemed panel hosted by Niferteriah Jones.</p>

			<p><em>Black Latina - The Play</em><br />
			Black Latina is the story of being a Black Latina in the U.S. Whether dark skinned or indeed African American and Hispanic, Black Latina is the journey of one&rsquo;s struggle identifying with both cultures. It deals with both the external factors, from society to media, as well as the internal factors of family and friends viewpoints.</p>

			<p><em>The Colors of Love - Stage Play</em><br />
			The Colors of Love is a play surrounding four equally different couples in various stages of their lives. Each pair of lovers is working through their relationship and attempting to find the true meaning of happiness, while achieving and maintaining a level of self gratification and satisfaction.</p>
