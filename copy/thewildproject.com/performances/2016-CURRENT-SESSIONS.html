			<p>The CURRENT SESSIONS presents the 10th edition of our biannual performances series, Volume VI, Issue I., from March 11 to 13, 2016 at the wild project theater in the East Village. From the highly-physical and the emotional to the visually striking and the clever, Volume VI, Issue I. organizes twelve artists within four curated collections of dancemaking - Female Forms, Design vs. Narrative, Distorting the Frame, and Sound Score - in order to capture the contemporary moving body and its ever-evolving self.</p>

			<p>Additional programming includes a TalkBack discussion to follow the 3pm Sunday performance, opening and closing receptions to follow the Friday and Sunday evening performances, and a pay-what-you-wish creative lab and workshop movement series for both dancers and for the public taking place prior to the weekend.</p>

			<p>Volume VI, Issue I. is curated by Alexis Convento, Founder &amp; Producing Director, Allison Jones, Development Associate and with guest curators Lydia Mokdessi, Editor at Culturebot; Niall Jones, artist; and Risa Shoup, Executive Director of Fourth Arts Block. Learn more about what we do, our artists, and upcoming events at <a href="http://www.thecurrentsessions.com/up-next" target="_blank">www.thecurrentsessions.com/up-next</a>.</p>

			<p><em>PROGRAMMING SCHEDULE</em></p>

			<p><em>Friday, March 11, 2016 at 7:30pm<br />
			01 Female Forms: On Embodiment, Dominance + Wit</em><br />
			This all-female roster reconciles the dominant and the submissive with magic and disillusionment. Each work will explore a woman&rsquo;s partiality via the social and the personal, through discovery, wit and self-loathing manifested from within the body. With works by Alessandra Giambelli + Dancers, ChristinaNoel and the Creature, Holly Wilder // Wilder Project, Moriah Ella Mason, Project|Oracle, and guest artist Shandoah Goldman // Carte Blanche Performance.</p>

			<p><em>Saturday, March 12, 2016 at 7:30pm<br />
			02 Design vs. Narrative: Visualizing Pattern, Story, plus Ways of Intersection</em><br />
			A series of encounters looking at the crossing of design and narrative through the moving body, with works exploring space both through physical means, as well as imagination and surrealism. Works by Charlotte Colmant, Holly Wilder // Wilder Project, Lillian Stamey &amp; Blake Horn (film), Teddy Tedholm // tedted Performance Group, Tsai Hsi Hung + Guang-Lei Hui // Cross Move, and guest artist Mariana Giovannini + Jacopo Jenna (film - Italy).</p>

			<p><em>Sunday, March 13, 2016 with Talkback at 3pm<br />
			03 Distorting the Frame: Looking Beyond the Constructs of the Proscenium Stage</em><br />
			Choreographers will extend, alter, and reimagine the proscenium stage by coupling performance with projected visual landscapes, cinematography, or audience engagement in uncommon locations throughout the wild project venue. &ldquo;Distorting the Frame&rdquo; looks to challenge and reformat average perceptions of how and where to make dances in order to expand the simple idea that dance can be anywhere, everywhere, and anything. With works by Alessandra Giambelli + Dancers, Charlotte Colmant, Kathleen Kelley, Lillian Stamey &amp; Blake Horn (film), Teddy Tedholm // tedted Performance Group, and guest artist Mariana Giovanni + Jacopo Jenna ( film - Italy). A Talkback panel discussion with a facilitator to be announced will follow the performance. Please note that heavy visuals will be used during the duration of the program.</p>

			<p><em>Sunday, March 13, 2016 at 7pm<br />
			04 Sound Score: Live Renditions, Spoken Dialogue + From the Body</em><br />
			To conclude Volume VI, Issue I, we will look at sound and ways in which it can compliment movement and enhance the performance experience, whether that be through live accompaniment, original score, spoken text, or from the body, itself. With works by ChristinaNoel and the Creature, Kathleen Kelley, Moriah Ella Mason, Project|Oracle, Tsai Hsi Hung + Guang-Lei Hui // Cross Move, and guest artist Shandoah Goldman // Carte Blanche Performance.</p>
