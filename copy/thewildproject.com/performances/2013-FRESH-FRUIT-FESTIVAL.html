<p>The 11th-annual FRESH FRUIT FESTIVAL, a celebration of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender arts and culture, comes to the Wild Project. The annual smorgasbord of LGBT performance features solo performances, readings, one act plays, ten-minute plays, full-length dramas, music, comedies and a look at what is new in internet video. Highlights include Kellie Dunham and Gene Murphy&rsquo;s QUEER MEMOIRS, where queer writers, poets, and storytellers weave stories on the topic of &quot;ashes&quot; into an interlocking pattern of queer lives and experiences; and Duncan Phlaster&rsquo;s ST KRISTIE, a look at Christianity and religious myth.</p>
