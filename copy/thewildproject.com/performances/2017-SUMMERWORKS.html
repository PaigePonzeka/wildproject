			<p><img align="Right" alt="" hspace="5" src="img/clubbed-thumb-logo.jpg" vspace="5" />Clubbed Thumb commissions, develops and produces funny, strange and provocative new plays by living American writers. Clubbed Thumb is a groundbreaker, with a precise curatorial vision and a remarkable track record for launching artists&rsquo; careers; and an incubator, nurturing plays, collaborations, and above all artists, through thoughtfully deployed resources, opportunities, mentorship and hospitality.<br />
			<br />
			Clubbed Thumb&rsquo;s plays vary in style and content, but are always 90 minutes or under. They feature substantial and challenging roles for both men and women, are questioning, formally inventive, theatrical, and exhibit a sense of humor. Since its founding in 1996, the company has presented nearly 100 productions, and has been awarded 5 Obies, including the Ross Wetzsteon award for sustained excellence.</p>
