After a near-death experience, The Lady appears. Is she an inner guide from the Jungian collective unconscious? Or a musical hallucination resulting from a small stroke? Gregory is pushed out of his solitary reality by his unlikely muse, and down the rabbit hole of mid-life crisis where he enters into a turbulent, dangerous relationship with a young male escort named &quot;Chance.&quot;<br />

			<p><em>Watch Me Burn</em><br />
			by Rae Binstock<br />

			<br />
			Prometheus &ldquo;Methe&rdquo; Graham, a young black New York City firefighter, is determined to rely on herself and no one else. But the heat is rising: the stresses of her mother&rsquo;s recent death, her teenage sister&rsquo;s rebellion, her captain&rsquo;s doubts, and the disapproval of her Harlem neighbors create an ongoing psychic holocaust that threatens to consume her from within. There are those, like Methe&rsquo;s unexpected lover Sophia or her firehouse buddy Andre, who try but cannot penetrate her self-selected isolation; nor, when the times comes, can they spare her the revenge taken by the flames she has fought so hard to conquer.</p>

			<p><em>Where&rsquo;s Hope? Where&rsquo;s Hope? Oh, God, Where&rsquo;s Hope?</em><br />

			Thursday 21st, 7 pm; Saturday 23rd, 8:30 pm; Sunday 24th, 1:30 pm<br />
			<br />
			Over the course of thirty years our perceptions of the past change. A love triangle, a midnight storytelling, a drowning, and a murder/suicide may not be what they seem. Set in Florida of the 1960s, Frederik Kirwin&rsquo;s poetic play is a sometimes comic discourse on revenge, pride, ambition, jealousy, wanderlust, sibling rivalry, sexual innocence, reversal of fortunes, and a baseball game.</p>

			<p><em>DANCE</em></p>
