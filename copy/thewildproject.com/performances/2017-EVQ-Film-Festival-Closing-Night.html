			5 mins (US)<br />
			A teaser video introducing BY NIGHT, a narrative series of vignettes that tell the story of the many varied characters who live and work within the burlesque and cabaret nightlife community in New York City and the duality of their lives. Some embrace this dichotomy and some struggle with it, but all of them chose this world for a reason...</td>

			Mr. Choade, the director of The House of Choade, a Grand Guignol theatre, has made an evil bargain with the Medicine Man, who has promised to help him make an artistic leap. A young girl, Linda, who has just been released from a mental hospital, gets a job performing at the House of Choade and becomes embroiled in these machinations. Linda&#39;s ex-girlfriend Roxy reconnects with her and attempts to save her. This film, a dark comedy by first time director James Habacker, was shot in Manhattan and features many luminaries from the downtown performance art scene centered around the Slipper Room.</td>
