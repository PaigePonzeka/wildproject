			<p><em>Special Event - Monday 7/22 @ 7pm (One Night Only)</em><br />
			<br />
			<em>Mediterraneo by Amos Pinhasi / Pieles (Paula Quintana, Spain, Dance)</em><br />
			<br />
			<em>Mediterraneo by Amos Pinhasi</em><br />
			NYC-based, Israeli dancer and choreographer Amos Pinhasi will open this year&rsquo;s festival with Mediterraneo -- a solo exploring childhood memories of a boy growing up by the beach of the Mediterranean sea. Personal exploration, fantasy and ironic political commentary are woven like a stream of consciousness. Memories of discovering the realm of the senses are re evoked to highlight the absurd of a militaristic upbringing in the land of milk and honey.<br />
			<br />
			<em>Pieles (Paula Quintana, Spain, Dance)</em><br />
			Somebody&#39;s Jacket... Somebody&#39;s jacket which awakens our skin. Skin as a symbol of feelings, of instinct, of emotions, in conflict. A constant struggle of feelings which are nearly always at odds with each other and with us. Pieles (Skin) is an emotional journey combining theater, contemporary dance and flamenco, in which we reconcile ourselves with the humanity of our passions and our instincts, letting the skins smell, sweat, bleed, change and feel.</p>

			<p><em>Tuesday 7/23</em><br />
			<br />
			<em>7pm: d r t (Mari Meade Dance USA/Turkey, Dance)</em><br />
			With d r t, Turkish choreographer Korhan Basaran (a guest artist in BTS 2012) creates a piece for 4 same gender dancers, continuing his quest into the unknown, stepping into it &ldquo;with a genuine and honest idea, like holding your heart in your hands and sharing it with the others&rdquo;.<br />
			<br />
			<em>Amongst Millions (Pedro Goucha Gomes, Portugal, Dance)</em><br />
			With the current European crisis in mind, Portuguese choreographer P. Gomes has created a 30 minutes long choreography that focuses on the general feelings of frustration, alienation and fear observed in the artist&#39;s native country over the past couple of years. In Amongst Millions the body is used as a vehicle for protest: with crude expressiveness, the body is presented as a space inhabited by a wide range of feelings without any filter or artifice. Moving beyond representation to embody only experience, Amongst Millions is a ritualistic work with no ornamentation.<br />
			<br />
			<em>9pm: The Bridge (Vanessa Tamburi, FLUSSO Dance Project, USA/Italy, Dance) / Pieles (Paula Quintana, Spain, Dance)</em><br />
			&ldquo;I know that I am, because I know there is other than me &rdquo; (J. Tischner). Vanessa Tamburi&#39;s newest creation explores the Bridge as a metaphor: a reflection on identities, borders, on welcome, on exclusion; a reflection on difference as a source of conflict and inspiration.</p>

			<p><em>Wednesday 7/24</em><br />
			<br />
			<em>8pm: Redshift (by Y. Mavritsakis, Greece, Theater)</em><br />
			With a member of a board as the main character Redshift tells the story of a parasitosis in all its stages from the infection and the incubation to the hatching and the parasite&#39;s final emergence.<br />
			<br />
			Between the Seas is proud to come on board as the producer for the world premiere of Redshift and the English language premiere of one of Europe&#39;s most distinctive playwrights, Y. Mavritsakis.</p>

			<p><em>Thursday 7/25</em><br />
			<br />
			<em>7pm: City State (by Kanigunda Theater, Greece, Theater)</em><br />
			&ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen, good evening. In a few days from now, the universe will fall on our heads. Which is why you must learn your history.&rdquo; A mysterious sponsor stages a theatre production before the audience. He invites the play&#39;s characters to remember the history of their city, Athens. Song and dance, comedy and drama, historical narrations, politicians and citizens, doctors and patients. The lesson begins with a reference to the defining features of the ancient Greek city-state: freedom, independence, self-sufficiency. Then come the blood, the city planning, the people, the building materials, the conquerors. Roland Barthes insists that &ldquo;the city is a discourse&rdquo;. It speaks to its inhabitants and they speak to it by living in it, by wandering through it. The city is a text, too, whose user is also its reader and forms their identity through its narratives. The characters in City-state are users and readers of Athens. They speak the language inscribed on them by the city itself. The production takes a snapshot of their Athens and invents its (hi)story...<br />

			<em>9:30pm: d r t (Mari Meade Dance USA/Turkey, Dance) / Amongst Millions (Pedro Goucha Gomes, Portugal, Dance) / The Bridge (Vanessa Tamburi, FLUSSO Dance Project, USA/Italy, Dance)</em><br />

			<br />
			<em>9:30pm: Rebeca Tomas - A Palo Seco Flamenco (USA, Dance)</em><br />
			The phrase a palo seco refers to the &quot;a cappella&quot; style of flamenco music, typically consisting of singing or percussion alone. That stripped-down aesthetic characterizes some of the company&#39;s biggest departures from tradition, featured in this production of Tradiciones Nuevas. While implementing typical Flamenco props, such as the bata de cola (long-train dress) and abanico (Spanish fan), the repertoire in this production will feature the company&rsquo;s penchant for unconventional fare with an innovative and edgy New York feel.</p>

			<p><em>Saturday 7/27</em><br />
			<br />
			<em>2pm: Eyes (Arab Hebrew Theater of Jaffa, Israel, Theater)</em><br />
			A Theatrical musical journey, of three actresses, one actor and one camera, following the poems of the poet Mahmoud Darwish. A surreal expedition on a theatre stage, traveling between his childhood in the Galilee to exile in Lebanon. In this trip the actors meet the poet and themselves through the encounter with the mother of the poet, with the revered teacher Shoshana, and through the reunion with Rita - his Jewish lover. The Journey is performed in two languages, Hebrew and Arabic, by Arab and Jewish actors, accompanied by Mira Awad&#39;s music and performance. This journey, directed by Norman Issa, enables the Arab-Hebrew audience to meet, here and now, the outstanding poetry by Darwish as well as the landscapes, conflicts and experiences of living in this country.<br />

			<br />
			<em>9:30pm: Suite Camus (Andreas Arnold, Music/Multimedia, Germany/France/Algeria)</em><br />
			Suite Camus is an interdisciplinary work, an osmosis of music, textx and images that leads into the heart of Camusian ideas and aesthetics. Initiated by the Goethe Institut Paris at the occasion of A. Camus&#39; centenary, the project is a meeting of outstanding young artists from Algeria, France and Germany. The Suite is based on a structure that stems from an entry in Camus&#39; diary from 1945. Here he lists his &ldquo;dix mots preferes&rdquo;, the ten words most important to him and his work: &ldquo;world, pain, earth, mother, man, desert, honor, misery, summer, sea&rdquo;. Musician Andreas Arnold has composed pieces for each of these key word, fusing elements of jazz, flamenco and electronica to a unique synthesis.</p>
