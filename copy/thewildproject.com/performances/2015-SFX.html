			<p><em>Night Bazaar</em><br />
			January 8 @ 8PM | Heather Litteer</p>

			<p>Heather Litteer curates the opening night party with performative interviews of female legends from the downtown arts scene. Continuing her series of interviews with longtime community members and artists of the East Village, Lower East Side and Brooklyn, these oral histories provide crucial links between threads of performance traditions and offer perspectives on the particular conditions that give rise to urban performance cultures. An open forum, these peer-to-peer discussions between established artists give an insider&rsquo;s view to &ldquo;outsider&rdquo; expression: the struggles, strategies and successes of creating an artist&rsquo;s life. Heather Litteer is the 2014 recipient of the Fox Foundation Resident Actor Fellowship.</p>

			January 8 @ 10:30PM &amp; January 9 @ 11AM | Adrienne Truscott</p>

			<p>A One-Lady Rape About Comedy Starring Her Pussy and Little Else<br />
			<br />
			Adrienne Truscott, one-half of the infamous Wau Wau Sisters, dressed only from the waist up and the ankles down, undresses and dresses down the rules and rhetoric about rape, comedy and the awkward laughs in between. With commentary from George Carlin, Louis C. K. and Robert De Niro, ducks, whistles, and enough gin and tonics to get a girl in trouble, she lets her pussy do the talking. Set to pop music. Can you make jokes about rape? She plans to, all night long.</p>

			January 9 @ 5:30PM | Book Launch</p>

			<p>Book Launch Contemporary Performance is publishing the 2nd annual Contemporary Performance Almanac 2015, an overview of live work created or presented during the 2013/2014 season. Crowd-funded and open-source, last year&rsquo;s almanac showcased over 350 participating artists and companies. So often presenters do not have access to the work of artists that are outside the touring circuit&mdash; this vital resource provides both artists and presenters a means to find each other and start new working relationships.</p>

			January 9 @ 8PM | Mixed Bill</p>

			<p>Guest curator Ben Gansky, Cloud City. An evening of new works and works-in-progress from the Contemporary Performance network revealing radical fresh bleeding-edge trans-medial experiments in performance. From young makers breaking into and out of the performance scene, this evening event brings together vital forces that are shaping the next frontier of performativity. Existing between the black box of experimental theatre and the white rooms of the art museum, gray spaces explore the marginal zones of performance.</p>

			<p><em>&quot;group&quot;</em><br />
			January 10 @ 11AM &amp; 10:30PM | Institute for New Feeling</p>

			<p><em>Audience space limited.</em> &ldquo;group&rdquo; is a full-sensory live music and video performance that engages audience members in eye contact, cardiovascular, breathing, and physical contact exercises&mdash;all techniques pulled directly from research and experience with corporate team building exercises, contact improvisation, Viewpoints training, group meditation, yoga, and sensory deprivation. However, group also plays with the absurd language, commercialism and forced intimacy of corporate team-building programs, allowing participants to be completely engrossed in the experience one minute, and to laugh at themselves in the next. Please be aware that this is a highly interactive experience and there is no sitting on the sidelines. Seating will only provided to audience members with special needs. Participants in a group session should expect an experience more like a movement workshop or yoga class than a simple stage performance. For more info visit <a href="http://www.iamgroup.me/" target="_blank">www.iamgroup.me</a> and read our group member agreement.</p>
