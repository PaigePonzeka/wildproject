			A lonely young man rhythmically narrates his leap from isolation to ecstasy when he meets a beautiful stranger in a bar. Sitting alone at the bar of a shadowy dance club, Otter drinks beer after beer, attempting to combat his inability to connect with other gay men. Suddenly he finds himself next to Jack, an ineffably intoxicating young man who is similarly alone. The two descend into the lamp-lit streets and alleys of the city, together escaping the thought of another lonely night.</td>

			Starring &lsquo;Queen of Erotica&rsquo; Miss Kitten Natividad, cult retro rocker King Khan, Mexican Elvis El Vez, narration by Aussie rock devil Tex Perkins and a stomping sound track by some of Melbourne&rsquo;s finest garage rockers, &lsquo;Fags in the Fast Lane&rsquo; is set in a hyper-real world packed with bizarre characters, revolting villains, and larger than life heroes. When Beau and his Herculean sidekick set off to avenge a spree of violent attacks on their fellow gays, he is waylaid on a vital mission for his beloved mama, Kitten, when her GILF bordello is robbed by the giantess leader of a grotesque burlesque show. With the help of a lethal cross dressing Persian Princess and a Bollywood eunuch assassin, this unlikely team of avengers set off to retrieve the lost booty in a full-throttle, rock &lsquo;n&rsquo; roll feast of camp destruction and dangerous dance numbers. Will they be able to recover Kitten&rsquo;s beloved jewels and magical golden phallus? They&rsquo;d better!</td>
