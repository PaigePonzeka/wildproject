In this rare opportunity, they will be collaborating with Truthworker Theatre Company, whose work interrogates the prison industrial complex, interweaving dynamic multimedia performance to create a poignant conversation between the two groups. Climbing PoeTree will be sharing excerpts from their upcoming album, a collaboration with over 20 musicians, as well as pieces from their award winning production Hurricane Season, astutely braided with vignettes from Truthworker&#39;s hip-hop theater production Bar Code: A Performative Analysis of the School-to Prison Pipeline.

			<em>Subverted</em><br />
			written by and featuring Dominique Fishback<br />
			directed by Chad Chenail<br />
			Choreography by Daigi-Ann Thompson<br />
			<br />
			SUBVERTED portrays the destruction of Black identity as seen through the eyes of Eden, an 18 year-old girl living in any urban city in the USA. Through the colliding viewpoints of 18 friends, family members, and historical figures (all portrayed by actor, writer, and spoken word poet Dominique Fishback) Eden discovers that the promise of &quot;equal opportunity&quot; still, to this day, does not exist. She questions why the people she loves the most continue to live blindly subverted by an unrelenting history that they did not live through, yet inherit and must accept. Eden&#39;s journey will make a difference in our understanding of what true equality actually looks like.</p>

			<em>Love &amp; War: The Battle of the Heart</em><br />
			directed and choreographed by Keomi Tarver<br />

			Featuring Keomi Tarver, Autumn Oftedal, Sharifa Linton, Candace Tabbs, Gabriella Bruno, Jerijah West, Jeanann Verlee and True<br />
			<br />
			Mixing dance and poetry, Love &amp; War creates a space for the complexities of being a woman of color. Using movement, poetry and music, Keomi welcomes the vulnerability love and war brings to the surface. She boldly shares her moments of shame, and her experiences while learning to live in her body and being with all the magic, anguish, and divinity within her. She chooses to find the worthy in all of her, finding the beauty of being broken and how it lets light, not only in, but out. Showing how opposing extremes can occupy the same space, finding the grace and love in the midst of the war. Leaning on and supporting women while creating abundance and celebration in womanhood along the way, every city will feature local artists, creating relevance and representation. Love &amp; War asks all the hard questions we keep tucked away due to fear, leaving us exposed and, eventually, free.</p>

			<br />
			Still grieving her own recent loss, hardheaded attorney, Sienna is recruited to challenge the court that sentenced 17 year old Katrice Willets to life in prison for murder. As Katrice&#39;s fiery will tests Sienna&#39;s restraint, they discover that although they occupy vastly different worlds, they are bound by a communal inheritance of black girl grief. &quot;30,000 Teeth&quot; is a sharply written account of what it means to be, at once, invisible and spectacle; to beguile and to bite back.</p>

			<em>So You Can Hear Me</em><br />
			written by and featuring Safiya Martinez<br />
			<br />
			So You Can Hear Me is a love letter to the youth culture that emerges from New York City. Its language speaks with urgency, swagger, and vulnerability. The work is an exploration of the universal human desire for love. Through interconnected narratives, each character voices an essential desire to be seen and heard, clearly.<br />
			<br />
			&ldquo;At the top of the play, I focus on the transformation of the grittier reality of New York from my childhood during the 1980s to the multitude of issues that arise with present-day gentrification. The current climate within the school system reflects these issues in complex and painful ways. Through this work I explore how safety, aggression, and resistance are negotiated within the space of a school and how the larger economic and political climate of the city informs the lives of students and teachers.&rdquo; -Safiya Martinez</p>

			<em>La Paloma Prisoner - Staged Reading</em><br />
			written by Raquel Almazan<br />
			directed by Mei Ann Teo<br />
			produced by Aaron Simms and Raquel Almazan&rsquo;s La Lucha Arts with Tiffany Vega<br />
			<br />
			La Paloma Prisoner (the staged reading series) combines women who have experienced the criminal justice system alongside performers to engage with audiences with the themes of mass incarceration. Panel discussion on Stopping Mass Incarceration to follow directly after the reading.<br />
			<br />
			Funded by the Arthur J. Harris Social Justice Art Grant in association with Columbia University.<br />
			<br />
			La Paloma Prisoner is a multidisciplinary play about the reclamation of identity by incarcerated women in the Colombian prison system. This new play centers on an incarcerated killer nicknamed &ldquo;La Paloma&rdquo; who transcendentally soars beyond physical and societal barriers to avenge the raped women of Bogota, leading the public to believe La Paloma may have magical avenger abilities. Based on the true story of a group of female inmates selected every year as beauty queen contestants at the Buen Pastor prison in Bogota, this new play interweaves the ritualistic journey of a &ldquo;parade of prisoners&rdquo; with Colombia&rsquo;s social, political, and spiritual history. Claiming of this newfound power, the women redefine beauty, their own humanity, and their identity as criminals. La Paloma Prisoner revolutionizes not only the women&rsquo;s lives, but prison society and the world beyond its walls.</p>

			<em>What I Tell You in the Dark - Staged Reading</em><br />
			Written by: Keelay Gipson<br />
			<br />
			Told in two parts, What I Tell You in the Dark is an exploration of how much one is willing to share and the consequences, unforeseen, that public self-discovery may have in the long run. In part one, told as a folktale, a pre-adolescent city boy is shipped off to his Southern relatives for the summer. He gets schooled in the way of &quot;growing up Southern&quot; by his Auntie, his Aunt and his cousin. While there, he learns more about himself than he bargained for and his family, mainly his cousin, leave an indelible mark on him that he takes with him into adulthood. In part two, our protagonist returns to his Auntie&#39;s house after the success of a book based on his experience during his first summer. The unexpected passing of his Aunt causes him to confront the memories that have become the basis of his success and the people he included in his retelling of his past.</p>
