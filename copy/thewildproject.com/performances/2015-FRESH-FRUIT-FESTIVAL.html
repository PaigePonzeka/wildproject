			<p><em>THE LEARS: Fools of Fortune</em> &ndash; World Premiere<br />
			<br />
			By Patrick Thomas McCarthy. Suggested by Shakespeare&rsquo;s KING LEAR, this contemporary American telling has Alzheimers-addled Captain of Industry, Edgar Reginald Lehman Lear, gathering those closest to him for an advance reading of the will at Thanksgiving dinner. Homicide, a blinding, poisonings, betrayal, abuse, sibling rivalries, cross dressing, arm wrestling (and even loyalty, redemption &amp; love!) find their way into the turbulent mix. Anyone who has experienced &ldquo;family&rdquo; will appreciate this work.<br />
			<br />
			Monday July 13, 7:30 pm &ndash; Tuesday July 14th, 9pm &ndash; Wednesday July 15th, 9 pm &ndash; Sunday July 19th, 4 pm</p>

			<p><em>BLUE FIRE ON THE WATER</em> &ndash; A Memory Play with Music and Multi-media<br />
			<br />
			&ldquo;Can&lsquo;t go backwards if you gon play the song right&rdquo;<br />
			<br />
			What happens when our shelter, cars, clothes, loves &ndash; every instrument we use to connect our lives or shield ourselves from the pains of this world &ndash; are scattered and swept away? Set in New Orleans, the play opens just after Katrina&rsquo;s rage and the flood begins. It spans 60 years exploring the love triangle of two Blues musicians and their manager. This piece speaks to musicians, African Americans, the aging, and anyone who has loved. As hurricane Katrina lashes New Orleans, and the flood waters rise, blues singer Joe reflects on the love he lost years back when he refused that time too to leave his home. A story of love and betrayal, with a bow to the real life travails of jazz artist Billy Tipton (who lived as a man although she was a woman). What has been called &ldquo;vibrant, poetic writing intermingled with The Blues&rdquo; will take the audience on an amazing personal journey.<br />

			A new play by critically acclaimed novelist Natalie Bates. The battle between love and fear, played out in a Chicago suburb of 1972. Two women, married with grown children, have discovered, to their astonishment, that they have fallen in love. So much more than a period piece, this &ldquo;honest, lyrical account of the cost of loving&rdquo; captures their journey to wrench free of conventional obligations and carve a space to live out their love.<br />

A feisty young journalist hoping to interview the reclusive composer comes to the inn. With demons of her own to manage, could she be a possible agent of redemption? But known only to the audience, the lover&rsquo;s spirit haunts the inn, and everything is fair game in the verbal confrontations to follow &ndash; old memories, painful secrets, and a very dramatic and cathartic conclusion.
